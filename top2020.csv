Salt air, and the rust on your door
I never needed anything more
Whispers of ""Are you sure?""
""Never have I ever before""

[Chorus]
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

[Verse 2]
Your back beneath the sun
Wishin' I could write my name on it
Will you call when you're back at school?
I remember thinkin' I had you

[Chorus]
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

Back when we were still changin' for the better
Wanting was enough
For me, it was enough
To live for the hope of it all
Cancel plans just in case you'd call
And say, ""Meet me behind the mall""
So much for summer love and saying ""us""
'Cause you weren't mine to lose
You weren't mine to lose, no

[Chorus]
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

[Outro]
'Cause you were never mine
Never mine
But do you remember?
Remember when I pulled up and said ""Get in the car""
And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all
""Meet me behind the mall""

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm bein' honest
It might've been a nightmare
To anyone who might care
Thought I could fly (Fly)
So I stepped off the Golden, mm
Nobody cried (Cried, cried, cried, cried)
Nobody even noticed
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care (Might care, might care)

I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

[Chorus]
And you say, ""As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'""

But my head was underwater

But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down

Beat it up, nigga, catch a charge
Extra large and extra hard
Put this pussy right in your face
Swipe your nose like a credit card
Hop on top, I wanna ride
I do a kegel while it's inside
Spit in my mouth, look in my eyes
This pussy is wet, come take a dive
Tie me up like I'm a surprise
Let's roleplay, I'll wear a disguise
I want you to park that big Mack truck right in this little garage
Make it cream, make me scream
Out in public, make a scene
I don't cook, I don't clean
But let me tell you how I got this ring (Ayy, ayy)

Need a Henny drinker, need a weed smoker
Not a garter snake, I need a king cobra
With a hook in it, hope it lean over
He got some money, then that's where I'm headed
Pussy A1 just like his credit
He got a beard, well, I'm tryna wet it
I let him taste it, now he diabetic
I don't wanna spit, I wanna gulp
I wanna gag, I wanna choke
I want you to touch that lil' dangly thing that swing in the back of my throat

Switch my wig, make him feel like he cheatin'
Put him on his knees, give him somethin' to believe in
Never lost a fight, but I'm lookin' for a beatin' (Ah)
In the food chain, I'm the one that eat ya
If he ate my ass, he's a bottom-feeder
Big D stand for big demeanor
I could make ya bust before I ever meet ya
If it don't hang, then he can't bang
You can't hurt my feelings, but I like pain
If he fuck me and ask ""Whose is it?""

Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

[Chorus]
But I knew you
Dancin' in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I

[Refrain]
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

[Verse 2]
A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls, lose the one
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
See Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $446You might also like[Chorus]
But I knew you
Playing hide-and-seek and
Giving me your weekends, I
I knew you
Your heartbeat on the High Line
Once in twenty lifetimes, I

[Refrain]
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

[Bridge]
To kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
But now I'm bleedin'

[Chorus]
'Cause I knew you
Steppin' on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I
I knew you
Tried to change the ending
Peter losing Wendy, I
I knew you
Leavin' like a father
Running like water, I
And when you are young, they assume you know nothing
[Verse 3]
But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
Chasin' shadows in the grocery line
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light
And I knew you'd come back to me
You'd come back to me
And you'd come back to me
And you'd come back

[Refrain]
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite174Embed","['Aaron Dessner', 'Taylor Swift']",['Aaron Dessner'],5793984,0.613,0.581,0,-8.588,0,0.0424,0.537,0.000345,0.25,0.551,130.033,audio_features,4LEK9rD7TWIG4FCL1s27XC,spotify:track:4LEK9rD7TWIG4FCL1s27XC,https://api.spotify.com/v1/tracks/4LEK9rD7TWIG4FCL1s27XC,https://api.spotify.com/v1/audio-analysis/4LEK9rD7TWIG4FCL1s27XC,239560,4," vintage tee, brand new phone high heels on cobblestones when you are young, they assume you know nothing sequin smile, black lipstick sensual politics when you are young, they assume you know nothing   but i knew you dancin' in your levi's drunk under a streetlight, i i knew you hand under my sweatshirt baby, kiss it better, i   and when i felt like i was an old cardigan under someone's bed you put me on and said i was your favorite   a friend to all is a friend to none chase two girls, lose the one when you are young, they assume you know nothing see taylor swift liveget tickets as low as $6you might also like but i knew you playing hide-and-seek and giving me your weekends, i i knew you your heartbeat on the high line once in twenty lifetimes, i   and when i felt like i was an old cardigan under someone's bed you put me on and said i was your favorite   to kiss in cars and downtown bars was all we needed you drew stars around my scars but now i'm bleedin'   'cause i knew you steppin' on the last train marked me like a bloodstain, i i knew you tried to change the ending peter losing wendy, i i knew you leavin' like a father running like water, i and when you are young, they assume you know nothing  but i knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss i knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs the smell of smoke would hang around this long 'cause i knew everything when i was young i knew i'd curse you for the longest time chasin' shadows in the grocery line i knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired and you'd be standin' in my front porch light and i knew you'd come back to me you'd come back to me and you'd come back to me and you'd come back   and when i felt like i was an old cardigan under someone's bed you put me on and said i was your favorite17",47.0

Yeah, I don't wanna fall asleep, I don't wanna pass away

I don't know why this has happened, but I probably deserve it

I been praying for forgiveness, you've been praying for my health
When I leave this earth, hopin' you'll find someone else
'Cause yeah, we still young, there's so much we haven't done
Getting married, start a family, watch your husband with his son
I wish it could be me, but I won't make it out this bed
I hope I go to heaven so I see you once again
My life was kinda short, but I got so many blessings
Happy you were mine, it sucks that it's all ending

Heart full of equity, you're an asset
Make sure that you don't need no mentions
Yeah, these are my only intentions

[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
Shout-out to your mom and dad for makin' you
Standin' ovation, they did a great job raisin' you
When I create, you're my muse
That kind of smile that makes the news
Can't nobody throw shade on your name in these streets
Triple threat, you a boss, you a bae, you a beast
You make it easy to choose
You got a mean touch, I can't refuse (No, I can't refuse it)

Talk to me, I need to hear you need me like I need ya
Fall for me, I wanna know you feel how I feel for you, love
Before you, baby, I was numb, drown out pain by pourin' up
Speedin' fast on the run, never wanna get caught up
Now you're the one that I'm callin'
Swore I thought I'd never fall again, don't think I'm just talkin'
I think I might go all in, no exceptions, girl, I need ya

Feeling like I'm out of my mind, 'cause I can't get enough

Might make an exception for ya, 'cause I been feelin' ya

I still remember, third of December
Me in your sweater, you said it looked better
On me than it did you, only if you knew
How much I liked you, but I watch your eyes as she

[Pre-Chorus]
Walks by
What a sight for sore eyes
Brighter than a blue sky
She's got you mesmerized while I die

[Chorus]
Why would you ever kiss me?
I'm not even half as pretty
You gave her your sweater, it's just polyester
But you like her better, wish I were Heather
[Verse 2]
Watch as she stands with her holding your hand
Put your arm 'round her shoulder, now I'm getting colder
But how could I hate her? She's such an angel
But then again, kinda wish she were dead as she

You broke me first

[Verse 1]
Maybe you don't like talkin' too much about yourself
But you shoulda told me that you were thinkin' 'bout someone else
You're drunk at a party or maybe it's just that your car broke down
Your phone's been off for a couple of months, so you're callin' me now
[Pre-Chorus]
I know you, you're like this
When shit don't go your way, you needed me to fix it
And like me, I did
But I ran out of every reason

[Chorus]
Now suddenly, you're askin' for it back
Could you tell me, where'd you get the nerve?
Yeah, you could say you miss all that we had
But I don't really care how bad it hurts
When you broke me first
You broke me first

[Verse 2]
Took a while, was in denial when I first heard
That you moved on quicker than I could've ever, you know that hurt
Swear for a while, I would stare at my phone just to see your name
But now that it's there, I don't really know what to say

Ugh, you're a monster

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I can swallow a bottle of alcohol and I'll feel like Godzilla
Better hit the deck like the card dealer
My whole squad's in here, walking around the party
A cross between a zombie apocalypse and B-Bobby ""The
Brain"" Heenan which is probably the
Same reason I wrestle with mania
Shady's in this bitch, I'm posse'd up
Consider it to cross me a costly mistake
If they sleepin' on me, the hoes better get insomnia
ADHD, Hydroxycut
Pass the Courvoisier (Hey, hey)
In AA with an AK, melee, finna set it like a playdate
Better vacate, retreat like a vacay, mayday (Ayy)
This beat is cray-cray, Ray J, H-A-H-A-H-A
Laughing all the way to the bank, I spray flames
They cannot tame or placate the

[Chorus: Juice WRLD with Eminem]
Monster
You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)
I'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (Yeah)
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
Godzilla, fire spitter, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet

I'm just a product of Slick Rick and Onyx, told 'em lick the balls
Had 'em just appalled, did so many things that pissed 'em off
It's impossible to list 'em all
And in the midst of all this
I'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball
Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?
Risperdal, voices whisper
My fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn
This is just the song to go ballistic on
You just pulled a pistol on the guy with a missile launcher
I'm just a Loch Ness, the mythological
Quick to tell a bitch screw off like a fifth of vodka
When you twist the top of the bottle, I'm a

[Verse 3: Eminem]
If you never gave a damn (Ayy), raise your hand
'Cause I'm about to set trip, vacation plans
I'm on point like my index is, so all you will ever get is
The motherfuckin' finger (Finger), prostate exam ('Xam)
How can I have all these fans and perspire?
Like a liar's pants, I'm on fire
And I got no plans to retire and I'm still the man you admire
These chicks are spazzin' out, I only get more handsome and flyer
I got 'em passin' out like what you do when you hand someone flyers
And what goes around comes around just like the blades on the chainsaw
'Cause I caught the flack, but my dollars stacked right off the bat like a baseball
Like Kid Ink, bitch, I got them racks with so much ease that they call me Diddy
'Cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk (Cheesecake, yeah)
Bitch, I'm a player, I'm too motherfuckin' stingy for Cher
Won't even lend you an ear, ain't even pretending to care
But I tell a bitch I'll marry her if she'll bury her
Face in my genital area, the original Richard Ramirez
Cristhian Rivera, 'cause my lyrics never sit well
So they wanna give me the chair
Like a paraplegic, and it's scary, call it Hari Kari
'Cause e'ry Tom and Dick and Harry carry a Merriam motherfuckin' dictionary on 'em
Swearing up and down they can spit, this shit's hilarious
It's time to put these bitches in the obituary column
We wouldn't see eye to eye with a staring problem
Get the shaft like a steering column (Monster)
Trigger happy, pack heat, but it's black ink
Evil half of the Bad Meets
Evil, that means take a back seat
Take it back to Fat Beats with a maxi single
Look at my rap sheet, what attracts these people
Is my 'Gangsta Bitch' like Apache with a catchy jingle
I stack chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto
Fill 'em with the venom and eliminate 'em
Other words, I Minute Maid 'em
I don't wanna hurt 'em, but I did, I'm in a fit of rage
I'm murderin' again, nobody will evade
I'm finna kill 'em and dump all their fuckin' bodies in the lake
Obliterating everything, incinerate a renegade
I'm here to make anybody who want it with the pen afraid
But don't nobody want it, but they're gonna get it anyway
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill
I'm Attila, kill or be killed, I'm a killer bee, the vanilla gorilla
You're bringin' the killer within me outta me
You don't wanna be the enemy of the demon who entered me
And be on the receivin' end of me, what stupidity it'd be
Every bit of me's the epitome of a spitter
When I'm in the vicinity, motherfucker, you better duck
Or you finna be dead the minute you run into me
A hundred percent of you is a fifth of a percent of me
I'm 'bout to fuckin' finish you, bitch, I'm unfadable
You wanna battle, I'm available, I'm blowin' up like an inflatable
I'm undebatable, I'm unavoidable, I'm unevadable
I'm on the toilet bowl, I got a trailer full of money and I'm paid in full

But it really got me thinkin', were you out drinkin'?
Were you in the living room, chillin', watchin' television?
It's been a year now, think I've figured out how

[Pre-Chorus: JP Saxe]
I know, you know, we know you weren't
Down for forever and it's fine
I know, you know, we know we weren't
Meant for each other and it's fine

[Chorus: JP Saxe]
But if the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
You'd come over and you'd stay the night
Would you love me for the hell of it?
All our fears would be irrelevant
If the world was ending, you'd come over, right?
The sky'd be falling and I'd hold you tight
And there wouldn't be a reason why
We would even have to say goodbye
If the world was ending, you'd come over, right? Right?
If the world was ending, you'd come over, right? Right?

How to think about you without it rippin' my heart out

This that hot girl bummer anthem

Hook up with someone random
This that social awkward suicide
That buy your lips and buy your likes
I swear she had a man
But shit hit different when it's Thursday night

What's poppin'? (Pooh, you a fool for this one)
Brand new whip, just hopped in (Just hopped in)
I got options (Oh Lord, Jetson made another one)
I could pass that bitch like Stockton (It ain't nothin')
Just joshin'
I'ma spend this holiday locked in (Ooh)
My body got rid of them toxins (Mmh, mmh)

[Verse]
I could put the ball in the end zone
Put a bad bitch in the friendzone, ooh
This shit sound like an intro
Jetson, give me that tempo, ooh
Told Pooh he a fool with this shit (He a fool)
Told her don't let her friends know (Don't)
In the 'Ville and I move like a don (Don)
Eating fettuccine at Vincenzo's
Me and my 'migos got that free smoke
On the West Coast, yeah, I'm talking 'bout pre-rolls (Pre-roll)
Dark haired bitch and she look like Shego (She do)
Hometown hero, feeling myself, can't murder my ego (Can't do it)
She heard of my deep stroke
She said, ""Babe, does it hurt when I deep throat?"" (It does)
Certified freak ho
Hang around us and she learnin' my lingo
Back then, wasn't worried 'bout me though
In the gym tryna work on my free throw
Goddamn (Goddamn)
Spending money at the club like Sam's (Cha-ching)
Yes, ma'am
She a lil' freak on cam (Facts)
But she don't put this on the 'Gram (Nah)
Lil' boys tryna diss on the 'Gram (Ayy)
I can't switch on the fam (Bitch)
Shit's hot, hit the switch on the fan (Hit that shit)
This where my head is (Listen)
I feel resentment from every direction
Even some homies be wearing expressions
I be discouraged from sharing my blessings (Damn)
We used to share a connection
Now it just feels like it's wearing and stretching
I'm getting real sick of taking advice
From people that never could stare at reflections (Ooh)
Somewhere in there is a lesson
Y'all ain't evolvin', it's very depressing
I'm at the club with the basketball team
Me and the Cardinals are sharing a section (Facts)
Gotta cherish the present
I'm drinking water and wearing protection
Got a career and I'm very invested
Some people call it a scary obsession (Ooh, period, but)
I like to call it a passion
I can't be sitting relaxin' (Nah, I can't)
PG, we getting some traction
I'm at the venue, it's packed in (Packed out)
I'm digging her accent
I got a B.B. Simon belt on me
And she tryna get it unfastened
That's my type of distraction
That's my type and she Latin (That's facts, ooh)
Got my own flow and I'm 'bout to get a patent
Brand new sheets for the bed, they satin (Soft, real soft)

Hope you see the better in me
Always end up betterin’ me

I spent the whole day in my head
Do a little spring cleanin'
I'm always too busy dreamin'
Well, maybe I should wake up instead
A lot of things I regret, but I just say I forget
Why can't it just be easy?
Why does everybody need me to stay?
Oh, I hate the feelin'
When you're high, but you're underneath the ceilin'
Got the cards in my hand, I hate dealin', yeah
Get everything I need, then I'm gone, but it ain't stealin'
Can I get a break?
I wish that I could just get out my goddamn way
What is there to say?
There ain't a better time than today
Well, maybe I'll lay down for a little, yeah
Instead of always tryin' to figure everything out
And all I do is say sorry
Half the time I don't even know what I'm sayin' it about

[Chorus]
Good news, good news, good news
That's all they wanna hear
No, they don't like it when I'm down
But when I'm flyin', oh

I'm no liar, but
Sometimes the truth don't sound like the truth
Maybe 'cause it ain't
I just love the way it sound when I say it, yeah
It's what I do
If you know me, it ain't anything new
Wake up to the moon, haven't seen the sun in a while
But I heard that the sky's still blue, yeah
I heard they don't talk about me too much no more
And that's the problem with a closed door

Put Your Records On,Ritt Momney,"32 ContributorsPut Your Records On Lyrics[Verse 1]
Three little birds sat on my window
And they told me I don't need to worry
Summer came like cinnamon, so sweet
Little girls double-dutch on the concrete

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Maybe sometimes we got it wrong, but it's all right
The more things seem to change, the more they stay the same
Don't you hesitate

[Chorus]
Girl, put your records on, tell me your favorite song
You go ahead, let your hair down
Sapphire and faded jeans, I hope you get your dreams
Just go ahead, let your hair down

[Post-Chorus]
You're gonna find yourself somewhere, somehow

[Verse 2]
Blue as the sky, sunburnt and lonely
Sipping tea in the bar by the roadside (Just relax, just relax)
Don't you let those other boys fool you
Gotta love that afro hairdo

I hear a lot about sinners
Don't think that I'll be a saint
But I might go down to the river
'Cause the way that the sky opens up when we touch
Yeah, it's makin' me say

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
I don't do well with the drama
And, no, I can't stand it being fake
(No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no)
I don't believe in nirvana
But the way that we love in the night gave me life
Baby, I can't explain

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star

But they don't see you how I see you, Parlay and Desi
Cross, Tween, Tween, Hesi' hit the jet speed
When they get messy, go lefty like Lionel Messi
Let's take a trip and get the Vespas or rent a Jet Ski
I know the spots that got the best weed, we goin' next week
I wanna honor, wanna honor you, bride's groom, I'm my father's child
I know when the son takes the first steps, the Father's proud (Yes)
If you make it to the water, He'll part the clouds (Uh)
I know He made you a snack like Oscar Proud (Mwah)
Suffer it to be so now gotta clean it up (Ooh)

[Verse 1]
Yeah, ain't tryna be cool like you
Wobblin' around in your high heel shoes
I'm clumsy, made friends with the floor
Two for one, you know a bitch buy four
And two left feet, you know I always drop
First thing a girl did was a bop
I'm the whole damn cake and the cherry on top
Shook up the bottle, made a good girl pop

You ain't even here to party
Ken in the club, tryna pipe a Barbie
I don't wanna go, go, go with the flow
Backbend 'til I touch my toes
I don't wanna row, row, row the boat
Wrist full of rocks and I hope I float
Big up yourself 'cause you know they don't

Everybody knows my name now
But somethin' 'bout it still feels strange
Like lookin' in a mirror, tryna steady yourself
And seein' somebody else
And everything is not the same now
It feels like all our lives have changed
Maybe when I'm older, it'll all calm down
But it's killin' me now

What if you had it all
But nobody to call?
Maybe then you'd know me
'Cause I've had everything
But no one's listening
And that's just fuckin' lonely

Like my house was always made of glass
And maybe that's the price you pay
For the money and fame at an early age
And everybody saw me sick
And it felt like no one gave a shit

Pull up, skrrt-skrrt on your body
Performin' just like my 'Rari
You're too fine, need a ticket
I bet you taste expensive
Pourin' up, up, up by the liter
If you keepin' up, you's a keeper
Tequila and vodka
Girl, you might be a problem

[Pre-Chorus]
Run away, run away, run away, run away, I know that I should
But my heart wanna stay, wanna stay, wanna stay, wanna stay now
You can see it in my eyes that I wanna take you down right now if I could
So I hope you know what I mean when I say

[Chorus]
Let me take you dancin'
Two-step to the bedroom
We don't need no dancefloor
Let me see your best move

Have it all, rip our memories off the wall
All the special things I bought
They mean nothin' to me anymore
But to you, they were everything we were
They meant more than every word
Now I know just what you love me for (Mmm)

[Pre-Chorus]
Take all the money you want from me
Hope you become what you want to be
Show me how little you care
How little you care, how little you care
You dream of glitter and gold
My hеart's already been sold
Show you how little I care
How littlе I care, how little I care

My diamonds leave with you (Mmm)
You're never gonna hear my heart break (Mmm)

Her titties is hard 'cause she spent a five, my bitch titties cost me a dub (21)
All my bitches got BBLs, all my bitches got butts (Straight up)

My Oh My (feat. DaBaby),Camila Cabello,"100 ContributorsTranslationsTürkçePolskiFrançaisPortuguêsMy Oh My Lyrics[Chorus: Camila Cabello]
They say he likes a good time (My oh my)
He comes alive at midnight (Every night)
My mama doesn't trust him (My oh my)
He's only here for one thing, but (So am I)

[Verse 1: Camila Cabello]
Yeah, a little bit older, a black leather jacket
A bad reputation, insatiable habits
He was onto me, one look and I couldn't breathe, yeah
I said, if he kissed me, I might let it happen (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus: Camila Cabello]
I swear on my life that I've been a good girl (Oh)
Tonight, I don't wanna be her

[Chorus: Camila Cabello & DaBaby]
They say he likes a good time (My oh my)
He comes alive at midnight (Every night)
My mama doesn't trust him (My oh my)
He's only here for one thing, but (Let's go, so am I)

[Verse 2: DaBaby & Camila Cabello]
Look, I'm the type to make her turn on her daddy (Oh yeah)
DaBaby make her forget what she learned from her daddy
I don't be tripping on lil' shawty, I let her do whatever she please
I don't be kissing on lil' shawty, she don't be kissing on me either
She came with you, then left with me
I went up a point, let's call it even (Yeah, yeah)
Don't like the car she in, gon' end up buyin' her a new Bimmer (Let's go)
That girl know what she want, she make me take it off when she see me (Let's go)
She say I make her wet whenever my face pop up on TV
I had to say, ""No disrespect, gotta do it safe or you can keep it""
Pop star, I'm fresh up out the trap and I'm going Bieber
She know I'm a call away, she can drop a pin and I'd come meet her
Stand next to me, you gon' end up catchin' a fever (Yeah, yeah)
I'm hot

Moral of the Story,Ashe,"79 ContributorsTranslationsTürkçeEspañolHrvatskiPortuguêsDeutschFrançaisMoral of the Story Lyrics[Verse 1]
So I never really knew you
God, I really tried to
Blindsided, addicted
Thought we could really do this
But really, I was foolish
Hindsight, it's obvious

[Pre-Chorus]
Talking with my lawyer
She said, ""Where’d you find this guy?""
I said, ""Young people fall in love
With the wrong people sometimes""

[Chorus]
Some mistakes get made
That's alright, that's okay
You can think that you’re in love
When you're really just in pain
Some mistakes get made
That's alright, that's okay
In the end, it's better for me
That's the moral of the story, babe

[Post-Chorus]
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)

It's funny how a memory
Turns into a bad dream
When running wild turns volatile
Remember how we painted our house
Just like my grandparents did
So romantic, but we fought the whole time
Should've seen the signs, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Talking with my mother
She said, ""Where’d you find this guy?""
Said, ""Some people fall in love
With the wrong people sometimes""

[Chorus]
Some mistakes get made
That’s alright, that's okay
You can think that you’re in love
When you're really just in pain
Some mistakes get made
That's alright, that's okay
In the end, it’s better for me
That's the moral of the story, babe

[Post-Chorus]
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
[Bridge]
They say it's better to have loved and lost
Than never to have loved at all
That could be a load of shit
But I just need to tell you all

[Chorus]
Some mistakes get made
That's alright, that's okay
You can think that you're in love
When you're really just engaged
Some mistakes get made
That's alright, that's okay
In the end, it's better for me
That's the moral of the story
Some mistakes get made
That's alright, that's okay
You can think that you're in love
When you're really just in pain
Some mistakes get made
That's alright, that's okay
In the end, it's better for me
That's the moral of the story, babe
