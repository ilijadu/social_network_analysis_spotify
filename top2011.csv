Set Fire to the Rain,Adele,"88 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolBahasa MelayuFrançaisالعربيةDeutschSet Fire to the Rain Lyrics[Produced by Fraser T. Smith]

[Verse 1]
I let it fall, my heart
And as it fell, you rose to claim it
It was dark, and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
My hands, they were strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet

[Pre-Chorus]
But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

[Chorus]
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name
Your name

When I lay with you
I could stay there, close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together, nothing is better

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

[Chorus]
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name
Your name
I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When we fell, somethin' died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time
The last time
[Bridge]
Sometimes, I wake up by the door
That heart you caught must be waitin' for you
Even now, when we're already over
I can't help myself from lookin' for you

[Chorus]
I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name
Your name
I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames

There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally, I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark

[Pre-Chorus]
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling

[Chorus]
We could've had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

[Verse 2]
Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you, now I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair

Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from cavin' in?
Do you ever feel already buried deep?
Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you?
'Cause there's a spark in you

[Pre-Chorus]
You just gotta ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""Awe, awe, awe""
As you shoot across the sky-y-y
Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, ""Awe, awe, awe""

It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every no—
Oh—ote
Make me your radio (Yeah, ha)
And turn me up when you feel low (Turn it up a little bit)
This melody was meant for you (Right there)
To sing along to my stereo (Gym Class Heroes, baby!)

[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]
If I was just another dusty record on the shelf
Would you blow me off and play me like everybody else?
If I asked you to scratch my back, could you manage that?
Like yikky-yeah check it, Travie, I can handle that
Furthermore, I apologize for any skipping tracks
It's just the last girl that played me left a couple cracks
I used to, used to, used to, used to, now I'm over that
'Cause holding grudges over love is ancient artifacts

[Pre-Chorus 1: Travie McCoy]
If I could only find a note to make you understand
I’d sing it softly in your ear and grab you by the hand
Just keep me stuck inside your head like your favorite tune
And know my heart's a stereo that only plays for you (Uh-ha-ha)

Would you hold me on your shoulder wherever you walk?
Would you turn my volume up in front of the cops? (Turn it up)
And crank it higher every time they told you to stop (Peace)
And all I ask is that you don't get mad at me
When you have to purchase mad D batteries
Appreciate every mixtape your friends make
You never know, we come and go like on the interstate (Never know)
[Pre-Chorus 2: Travie McCoy]

If you could hit it, sing along and take me by the hand

There's a stranger in my bed
There's a pounding in my head
Glitter all over the room
Pink flamingos in the pool
I smell like a minibar
DJ's passed out in the yard
Barbies on the barbecue
This a hickey or a bruise?

I'm screwed, oh well
It's a blacked-out blur, but I'm pretty sure it ruled
Damn

[Chorus]
Last Friday night, yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots, think we kissed, but I forgot
Last Friday night, yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar, so we hit the boulevard
Last Friday night, we went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark then had a ménage à trois
Last Friday night, yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop-op, oh-woah

Ripped my favorite party dress

It's like you're screaming, and no one can hear
You almost feel ashamed, that someone could be that important
That without them, you feel like nothing
No one will ever understand how much it hurts
You feel hopeless, like nothing can save you
And when it's over and it's gone
You almost wish you could have all that bad stuff back
So that you could have the good

[Verse 1]
Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive

It's the way I'm feeling, I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go

She want it, I can tell she want it

We get the party goin', liquor flowin', this is fire

Break it, break it, down, down (Just put it down on me)

Break it, break it, down

Okay, she headed to the dance floor and she slowly start to poppin' it
Somethin' like my wrist piece, everybody got to watchin it
Girl you got that secret treasure, I'm gon' put a lock on it
Don't care what they say, I would be stupid to be not on it
Ms. Vicky, heard you got that sticky
Let's go and take nine shots, we'll just call it fifty
And I'm gonna licky licky licky 'til her hicky
Ha-ha-have her river runnin', keep you gunnin' 'til you empty
(Bang bang bang bang) Oh, you look so sweet
What you work at Bally's? Look at your physique
Girl you are a beauty, well-well I am a beast
They must have been trippin' to have let me off a leash

[Chorus: Jeremih, 50 Cent & Jeremih]
I like the way you grind with that booty on me
Shorty you a dime, why you lookin' lonely?

You're so hypnotizing
Could you be the devil? Could you be an angel?
Your touch, magnetizing
Feels like I am floating, leaves my body glowing
They say, ""Be afraid""
You're not like the others, futuristic lover
Different DNA
They don't understand you

You're from a whole 'nother world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go, lead me into the light

[Chorus]
Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your lovin', fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be your victim, ready for abduction
Boy, you're an alien

It's supernatural

That you did everything right
No lies, no wrong
Boy, I must've been out of my mind

Thank God you blew it, I thank God I dodged the bullet, uh
I'm so over you, so baby, good lookin' out

[Chorus]
I wanted you bad, I'm so through with that
'Cause honestly, you turned out to be the best thing I never had
You turned out to be the best thing I never had
And I'm gon' always be the best thing you never had
Oh, yeah, I bet it sucks to be you right now

Just stop for a minute and smile
Why is everybody so serious?
Acting so damn mysterious
Got shades on your eyes
And your heels so high that you can't even have a good time

Champion (feat. Chris Brown),Chip,"31 ContributorsChampion Lyrics[Intro: Chris Brown, Chipmunk]
Some people have to learn
Some people wait their turn
Some people have to fight, yeah
Some people give their life, oh (Yeah)

[Verse 1: Chipmunk]
They wanna hold you back, tell 'em pee off
Whenever they say you can't, take the T off
I remember when they told me I wouldn't be famous
Now my dream and reality's simultaneous
And work your own way to the top
If they put you on a pedestal, they can take you off
And there's a higher level than the top
You gotta make more, don't make do with what you got
Yeah, so and get it in, sonny
Not everybody gets a second chance at gettin' money (Money)
Or even gettin' lucky
So you gotta feel the hunger in your tummy

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown, Chipmunk, Chris Brown & Chipmunk]
I'm always pushin' myself to the limit, makin' sure I stay ahead (That's right)
You made me who I am, from the words you said (Yeah)

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Chipmunk]
Some people have to learn (Aha, yeah)
Some people wait their turn (Aha, uh)
Some people but not me, yeah, oh
I was born a champion (That's right)
Some people have to fight (Aha)
Some people give their life (Aha)

Uh, this gon' be the realest shit I ever wrote
Off the records, no cameras, forget a quote
Some of my family doin' good, most doin' dope
I'm from Virginia where they hang them niggas by a rope
I used to see my momma gettin' beat down
Is that the real definition of me now?
I fell off, back on my feet now
Headed to the sky, can't even see down
Award shows, I pour my heart out
And people still steady tryna point my flaws out
And I'd be lyin' if I say it ain't get to me
But I'm a champion, legend, history

Okay, no one wants to help, I guess you're on your own
Build a foundation with the bricks they throw
In a black and white world, true colours show
Change if you want, everybody grows
And life's like an eel, but try and get a hold
Opinions ain't facts, take 'em in and let 'em go (That's right)

I might be too strung out on compliments
Overdosed on confidence
Started not to give a fuck and stopped fearin' the consequence
Drinkin' every night because we drink to my accomplishments
Faded way too long, I'm floatin' in and out of consciousness
And they sayin' I'm back, I'd agree with that
I just take my time with all this shit, I still believe in that
I had someone tell me I fell off, ooh, I needed that
And they want to see me pick back up, well, where'd I leave it at?
I know I exaggerated things, now I got it like that
Tuck my napkin in my shirt 'cause I'm just mobbin' like that
You know good and well that you don't want a problem like that
You gon' make someone around me catch a body like that
No, don't do it (Ayy), please don't do it (Ayy)
'Cause one of us goes in and we all go through it (Ayy)
And Drizzy got the money, so Drizzy gon' pay it
Those my brothers, I ain't even gotta say it
That's just something they know

[Chorus]
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know, they know

That new shit that you got is overdue
You better do what you supposed to do""
I'm like, ""Why I gotta be all that?""
But still, I can't deny the fact that it's true
Listening to you expressin' all them feelings

And that's who you thinkin' is 'bout to come and make a killin'?
I guess it really is just me, myself, and all my millions
You know that they ain't even got it like that
You gon' hype me up and make me catch a body like that

Apologize if I say anything I don't mean
Like, ""What's up with your best friend? We could all have some fun, believe me""
And, ""What's up with these new niggas? And why'd they think it all comes so easy?""
But get it while you here, boy
'Cause all that hype don’t feel the same next year, boy
Yeah, and I'll be right here in my spot
With a little more cash than I already got
Trippin' off you 'cause you had your shot
With my skin tan and my hair long and my fans who been so patient
Me and 40 back to work, but we still smell like a vacation
Hate the rumors, hate the bullshit, hate these fuckin' allegations
I'm just feelin' like the throne is for the takin' (Watch me take it)

Big Snoop Dogg

[Verse 1]
Can you be my doctor?
Can you fix me up?
Can you wipe me down?
So I can–I can make you give it up, give it up
Until you say my name
Like a Jersey, Jersey shuttin' down the game
Be my head coach
So you can–you can
And never take me out
'Til you can taste the way
Do it again, and again 'til you say my name
And by the way I'm so glad

[Chorus]
I just wanna make you sweat

Hold you like a paper plane
You know I got paper, babe
But—them dollar bills
Girl, I'll make it rain
Holiday Inn
Come and meet me on my 8th floor
Damn, it feels good but I feel bad for them maids, though
And I, and I–I–I apologize
But when I slip–I slip—I turn girls into slip n' slide

Lighters,Bad Meets Evil,"197 ContributorsLighters Lyrics[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
This one's for you and me
Livin' out our dreams
We're all right where we should be
Lift my arms out wide, I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters
[Verse 1: Eminem]
By the time you hear this, I will have already spiralled up
I would never do nothin' to let you cowards fuck my world up
If I was you I would duck, or get struck like lightnin'
Fighters keep fightin', put your lighters up, point 'em skyward, uh
Had a dream, I was king; I woke up, still king
This rap game's nipple is mine for the milking
'Til nobody else even fuckin' feels me, 'til it kills me
I swear to God I'll be the fuckin' illest in this music
There is, or there ever will be, disagree? Feel free
But from now on I'm refusing to ever give up
Only thing I ever gave up's using no more excuses
Excuse me if my head is too big for this building
And pardon me if I'm a cocky prick, but you cocks are slick
Poppin' shit on how you flipped your life around, crock of shit
Who you dicks tryna kid? Flip ""dick,"" you did opposite
You stayed the same 'cause ""cock"" backwards is still ""cock,"" you pricks!
I love it when I tell 'em shove it
‘Cause it wasn’t that long ago when Marshall sat flustered
Lacked luster ‘cause he couldn’t cut mustard
Muster up nothin', brain fuzzy
‘Cause he’s buzzin’, woke up from that buzz and
Now you wonder why he does it how he does it
Wasn’t ‘cause he had buzzards
Circlin' around his head, waitin' for him to drop dead, was it?
Or was it ‘cause some bitches wrote him off?
Little hussy-ass scuzzes
Fuck it, guess it doesn’t matter now, does it?
What difference it make? What’s it take?
To get it through your thick skulls that this ain’t
Some bullshit; people don’t usually come back this way
From a place that was dark as I was in just to get to this place
Now let these words be like a switchblade to a hater’s ribcage!
And let it be known that from this day forward, I wanna just say
Thanks, ‘cause your hate is what gave me the strength
So let them Bics raise, ‘cause I came with 5'9"", but I feel like I’m 6'8""

[Verse 2: Royce Da 5'9""]
By the time you hear this, I’ll prolly already be outtie
I advance like goin' from totin' iron to goin' and buyin’
Four or five of the homies the Iron Man Audi
My daddy told me: ""Slow down, boy, you're goin' to blow it!""
And I ain't gotta stop the beat a minute to tell Shady I love him
The same way that he did Dr. Dre on The Chronic
Tell him how real he is, or how high I am
Or how I would kill for him, for him to know it
I cried plenty tears, my daddy got a bad back
So it's only right that I write 'til he can march right
Into that post office and tell 'em to hang it up
Now his career's LeBron's Jersey in twenty years
I stop when I'm at the very top
You shitted on me on your way up, it's 'bout to be a scary drop
‘Cause what goes up must come down
You goin' down on somethin' you don't wanna see, like a hairy box
Every hour, happy hour now, life is wacky now
Used to have to eat the cat to get the pussy
Now I'm just the cat's meow, oww, outclass the count
Always down for the catchweight like Pacquiao
Y'all are doomed
I remember when T-Pain ain't wanna work with me
My car starts itself, parks itself, and auto-tunes
‘Cause now I'm in the Aston; I went from havin'
My city locked up to gettin' treated like Kwame Kilpatrick
And now I'm fantastic, compare it to a weed high
And y'all niggas that's gossipin' like bitches
On the radio and TV, see me, we fly
Y'all buggin' out like Wendy Williams starin' at a beehive
And how real is that? I remember signin' my first deal
Now I'm the second best, I can deal with that
Now Bruno can show his ass, without the MTV awards gag
[Bridge: Bruno Mars]
You and I know what it's like
To be kicked down, forced to fight
But tonight, we're all right
So hold up your lights
Let it shine, 'cause—

And I know that I can be a little cocky (No)
You ain't never gonna stop me

Then I gotta go, and then I gotta get it (Woo)
Then I gotta blow, and then I gotta show that
Any little thing a nigga think that he be doin' (Ooh-ooh)
'Cause it doesn't matter, 'cause I'm gonna da-da-da-da (Damn)
Then I'm gonna murder everything and anything
A ba-da-boom, a ba-da-bing, I gotta do a lotta things
That make it clearer to a couple niggas that I always win
And then I gotta get it again and again and then again
And I be doin' it to death
And now I move a little foul, a nigga better call a ref
And everybody know my style and niggas know that I'm the best
When it come to doin' this and I be bangin' on my chest
And I bang in the East and I'm bangin' in the West
And I come to give you more and I will never give you less
You will hear it in the street or you could read it in the press
Do you really wanna know what's next? (Let's go)
See the way we on and then we all up in the race
And you know we gotta go, don't try to keep up with the pace
And we strugglin' and hustlin' and sendin' in and gettin'
And we always gotta do it, take it to another place
Gotta taste it and I gotta grab it
And I gotta cut all through this traffic
Just to be at the top of the throne
Better know I gotta have it (Have it)

Found myself in the city near Piccadilly

Don't hold your breath
What you did to me, boy, I can't forget
If you think I'm coming back
Don't hold your breath

I was under your spell for such a long time, couldn't break the chains
You played with my heart, tore me apart with all your lies and games
It took all the strength I had but I crawled up on my feet again
Now you're trying to lure me back but no, those days are gone, my friend
I loved you so much that I thought someday that you could change
But all you brought me was a heart full of pain

But now you're grown up, so fly, it's like a blessin'
But you can't have a man look at you for five seconds

It seems like you came back ten times over

Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

Every Teardrop Is a Waterfall,Coldplay,"58 ContributorsEvery Teardrop Is A Waterfall Lyrics[Verse 1]
I turn the music up, I got my records on
I shut the world outside until the lights come on
Maybe the streets alight, maybe the trees are gone
I feel my heart start beatin' to my favorite song
And all the kids they dance, all the kids all night
Until Monday mornin' feels another life
I turn the music up, I'm on a roll this time
And Heaven is in sight

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
I turn the music up, I got my records on
From underneath the rubble, sing a rebel song
Don't want to see another generation drop
I'd rather be a comma than a full stop
Maybe I'm in the black, maybe I'm on my knees
Maybe I'm in the gap between the two trapezes
But my heart is beating and my pulses start
Cathedrals in my heart

It's hard to fight these feelings when it feels so hard to breathe
I'm caught up in this moment
I'm caught up in your smile

So hard to hold back when I'm holding you in my arms
But we don't need to rush this
Let's just take it slow

Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight
Just a touch of the fire burning so bright
No, I don't wanna mess this thing up
No, I don't wanna push too far
Just a shot in the dark that you just might
Be the one I've been waiting for my whole life
So baby, I'm alright with just a kiss goodnight

It'll only bring us closer to the love we wanna find

One more depending on a prayer
And we all look away
People pretending everywhere
It's just another day
There's bullets flying through the air
And they still carry on
We watch it happen over there
And then just turn it off

[Chorus]
(Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah)
We must stand together
(Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah)
There's no giving in
(Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah)

That's, that's, that's when we all win

[Verse 2]
They tell us everything's alright
And we just go along
How can we fall asleep at night
When something's clearly wrong?
When we could feed a starving world
With what we throw away
But all we serve are empty words
That always taste the same

Is right here inside us
No one can divide us
When the light is nearly gone
But just like a heartbeat
The drumbeat carries on
And the drumbeat carries on

In fact making it harder for me to see my father

Only thing was I never saw enough of you
The last thing I said to you was I hated you
I loved you and now it's too late to say to you
Just didn't know what to do and how to deal with it
Even now deep down I'm still livid
To think I used to blame me
I wonder what I did to you to make you hate me
I wasn't even 5, life's a journey and mine wasn't an easy ride
You never even got to see me rhyme
I just wish you woulda reached out
I wish you would have been round when I been down
I wish that you could see me now
Wherever you are I really hope you found peace
But know that if I ever have kids
Unlike you I'll never let them be without me

Six-six-foot, seven-foot, eight-foot bunch

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Ahem
Excuse my charisma, vodka with a spritzer
Swagger down pat; call my shit Patricia
Young Money militia, and I am the commissioner
You no wan' start Weezy 'cause the 'F' is for finisher
So misunderstood, but what's a world without enigma?
Two bitches at the same time; synchronized swimmers
Got the girl twisted 'cause she open when you twist her
Never met the bitch, but I fuck her like I missed her
Life is the bitch, and death is her sister
Sleep is the cousin—what a fuckin' family picture
You know Father Time, and we all know Mother Nature
It's all in the family, but I am of no relation
No matter who's buyin', I'm a celebration
Black and white diamonds; fuck segregation
Fuck that shit, my money up, you niggas just Honey Nut
Young Money runnin' shit, and you niggas just runner-ups
I don't feel I done enough, so I'ma keep on doin' this shit
Lil Tunechi or Young Tuna Fish, ha!

Okay
I lost my mind, it's somewhere out there stranded
I think you stand under me if you don't understand me
Had my heart broken by this woman named Tammy
But hoes gon' be hoes, so I couldn't blame Tammy
Just talked to Moms, told her she the sweetest
I beat the beat up; call it self-defense
Swear, man, I be seein' through these niggas like sequins
Niggas think they He-Men, pow, pow, the end
Talkin' to myself because I am my own consultant
Married to the money, fuck the world; that's adultery
You full of shit, you close your mouth and let yo' ass talk
Young Money eatin', all you haters do is add salt
Stop playin', bitch, I got this game on deadbolt
Mind so sharp, I fuck around and cut my head off
Real nigga all day and tomorrow
But these ma'fuckers talkin' crazy like they jaw broke
Glass half empty, half full, I'll spill ya
Try me and run into a wall; outfielder
You know I'ma ball 'til they turn off the field lights
The fruits of my labor, I enjoy 'em while they still ripe
Bitch, stop playin', I do it like a king do
If these niggas animals, then I'ma have a mink soon
Tell 'em bitches I say put my name on the wall
I speak the truth, but I guess that's a foreign language to y'all
And I call it like I see it, and my glasses on
But most of y'all don't get the picture 'less the flash is on
Satisfied with nothin', you don't know the half of it
Young Money, Cash Money... uh
Paper chasin', tell that paper, ""Look, I'm right behind ya""
Bitch, real G's move in silence like lasagna
People say I'm borderline crazy, sorta kinda
Woman of my dreams, I don't sleep, so I can't find her
You niggas are gelatin, peanuts to an elephant
I got through that sentence like a subject and a predicate
Yeah, with a swag, you would kill for
Money too strong; pockets on bodybuilder
Jumped in a wishin' well, now wish me well
Tell 'em kiss my ass, call it kiss and tell
[Verse 3: Cory Gunz]
Yeah, word to my mama, I'm out of my lima bean
Don't wanna see what that drama mean, get some Dramamine
Llama scream, hotter than summer sun on a Ghana queen
Now all I want is hits, bitch, Wayne signed a fiend
I-I play the side for you niggas that's tryna front, and see
Son of Gun, Son of Sam, you niggas the son of me
Pause for this dumber speech, I glow like Buddha
Disturb me, and you'll be all over the flo' like Luda
Bitch, I flow like scuba, bitch, I'm bold like Cuba
And I keep a killer ho, she gon' blow right through ya
I be mackin', 'bout my stackin', amount I pack like a mover
Shout to ratchet for backin' out on behalf of my shooter
Niggas think they high as I, I come laugh at your ruler
Cash Money cold, bitch, but our actions is cooler, Wayne
These niggas out they mind, I done told these fuck niggas so many times
That I keep them bucks steady on my mind, tuck these, I fuck these on your mind, pause
To feed them, on my grind, did I get a little love, keep throwin' my sign
In the middle, hit 'em up, piece on my side, ‘cause ain't no peace on my side

Dirt Road Anthem,Jason Aldean,"41 ContributorsDirt Road Anthem Lyrics[Chorus]
Yeah I'm chillin' on a dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscin' on them good times
I'm turning off of real life drivin', that's right
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires

[Verse 1]
Back in the day Pott's farm was the place to go
Load the truck up, hit the dirt road
Jump the barbwire, spread the word
Light the bonfire, then call the girls
The king in the can and the Marlboro man
Jack 'n' Jim were a few good men
Where ya learned how to kiss and cuss and fight too
Better watch out for the boys in blue
And all this small town he said, she said
Ain't it funny how rumors spread
Like I know something y'all don't know
Man that talk is getting old
Ya better mind your business, man, watch your mouth
Before I have to knock that loud mouth out
I'm tired of talkin', man, y'all ain't listening

I sit back and think about them good ol' days
The way we were raised and our southern ways
And we like cornbread and biscuits
And if it's broke round here we fix it
I can take y'all where you need to go
Down to my hood, back in them woods
We do it different 'round here, that's right
But we sure do it good and we do it all night
See, if you really wanna know how it feels
To get off the road with trucks and four wheels
Jump on in, and man, tell your friends
We'll raise some hell where the blacktop ends

Seven days of torture, seven days of bitter
And my girlfriend went and cheated on me
She's a California dime, but it's time for me to quit her

I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life
[Verse 1: Eminem]
I told the world, one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it
So that one day I could play it back
But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm sayin' that
Doubts startin' to creep in, every day, it's just so gray and black
Hope, I just need a ray of that, 'cause no one sees my vision
When I play it for 'em, they just say it's wack
But they don't know what dope is
And I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is, you came to me when I was at my lowest
You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you
But for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me you lost a son
Demons fightin' you, it's dark
Let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you
I don't think you realize what you mean to me
Not the slightest clue
'Cause me and you were like a crew, I was like your sidekick
You gon' either wanna fight when I get off this fuckin' mic
Or you gon' hug me, but I'm outta options

It hurts when I see you struggle, you come to me with ideas
You say they're just pieces, so I'm puzzled
'Cause the shit I hear is crazy
But you're either gettin' lazy or you don't believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form
Can't make a decision, you keep questionin' yourself
Second guessin' and it's almost like you're beggin' for my help
Like I'm your leader, you're supposed to fuckin' be my mentor
I can endure no more, I demand you remember who you are
It was you who believed in me when everyone was tellin' you
Don't sign me, everyone at the fuckin' label, let's tell the truth
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy
Dre, I'm cryin' in this booth
You saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours
But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more
But I ain't givin' up faith, and you ain't givin' up on me
Get up, Dre, I'm dyin', I need you

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
It literally feels like a lifetime ago
But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday, though
You walked in, yellow jump suit, whole room, cracked jokes
Once you got inside the booth, told you, mic smoke
Went through friends, some of them I put on, but they just left
They said they was ridin' to the death
But where the fuck are they now, now that I need them?
I don't see none of them, all I see is Slim
Fuck all you fair-weather friends, all I need is him
Fuckin' backstabbers
When the chips were down, you just laughed at us
Now you 'bout to feel the fuckin' wrath of Aftermath, faggots
You gon' see us in our lab jackets and ask where the fuck we been?
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack, maggots
And the cracker's ass, little cracker jack beat
Makin' wack math, backwards producers; I'm back, bastards
One more CD and then I'm packin' up my bags
And as I'm leavin', I'll guarantee they'll scream:
""Dre, don't leave us like that, man"", 'cause—
[Chorus: Skylar Grey]

You've been gone for so long

Hey
Ayo, Sap! What's good, bruh?
This man's kinda high out here *Laughs*

[Verse 1]
Ayo, the flyest ma'fucker in the room, yeah, you know it's me
Bitches hatin' on him 'cause he started out here locally
Hopefully, I'll be at the top soon
For now, I'm at my house on the couch watchin' cartoons
You know how much you love it when you get it in abundance
Give a fuck about a budget when you always be the subject of discussion
But it's nothin' when you stop and just say, ""fuck it""
'Cause you walkin' out in public and you hear 'em talkin' rubbish
I just wanna ride, ride through the city in a Cutlass
Find a big butt bitch somewhere, get my nuts kissed
That's the way it goes when you party just like I do
Bitches on my dick that used to brush me off in high school

[Chorus]
Take over the world when I'm on my Donald Trump shit
Look at all this money! Ain't that some shit?
Take over the world when I'm on my Donald Trump shit
Look at all this money! Ain't that some shit? (Hey)
We gon' take over the world while these haters gettin' mad
That's why all my bitches bad, they see this crazy life I have
And they in awe, we gon' win, you can take the lose or draw
What I'm in got these hoes who used to play me in they bras
We gon' take over the world while these haters gettin' mad
Take over the world, watch these haters get mad

And if she want an autograph she better bring a pen
Yeah, the party never end, this life is what I recommend
And if you got a ho picked for me, then she better be a 10

And don't you know I'm not your ghost anymore?

Wherever You Will Go,Charlene Soraia,"18 ContributorsWherever You Will Go LyricsSo lately, been wondering
Who will be there to take my place?
When I'm gone, you'll need love to light the shadows on your face
If a great wave shall fall, and fall upon us all
Then between the sand and stone, could you make it on your own?

If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low, I'll go wherever you will go

And maybe, I'll find out a way to make it back, someday
To watch you, to guide you, through the darkest of your days
If a great wave shall fall, and fall upon us all
Then I hope there's someone out there
Who can bring me back to you

If I could, then I would
I'll go wherever you will go
Way up high or down low, I'll go wherever you will...

No! Run away with my heart
Run away with my hope
Run away with my love

I know now, just quite how
My life and love might still go on
In your heart, in your mind, I'll stay with you for all of time

The A Team,Ed Sheeran,"185 ContributorsTranslationsDeutschThe A Team Lyrics[Verse 1]
White lips, pale face
Breathin' in the snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, days end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men

[Pre-Chorus]
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

[Chorus]
'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't wanna go outside tonight
And in a pipe, she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly
See Ed Sheeran LiveGet tickets as low as $48You might also like[Verse 2]
Ripped gloves, raincoat
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, banknotes
Weary-eyed, dry throat
Call girl, no phone

[Pre-Chorus]
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

[Chorus]
'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
But she don't wanna go outside tonight
And in a pipe, she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
[Bridge]
An angel will die
Covered in white
Closed eye and hopin' for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line

[Pre-Chorus]
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

[Chorus]
And we're all under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And we don't wanna go outside tonight
And in a pipe, we fly to the Motherland
Or sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
[Outro]
Angels to fly
Fly, fly
For angels to fly
To fly, to fly
Angels to die197Embed","['Ed Sheeran', 'Grant Edward Palmer']",['Jake Gosling'],60449,0.642,0.289,9,-9.918,1,0.0367,0.669,0.0,0.18,0.407,84.996,audio_features,1VdZ0vKfR5jneCmWIUAMxK,spotify:track:1VdZ0vKfR5jneCmWIUAMxK,https://api.spotify.com/v1/tracks/1VdZ0vKfR5jneCmWIUAMxK,https://api.spotify.com/v1/audio-analysis/1VdZ0vKfR5jneCmWIUAMxK,258373,4," white lips, pale face breathin' in the snowflakes burnt lungs, sour taste light's gone, days end struggling to pay rent long nights, strange men   'cause we're just under the upper hand and go mad for a couple grams and she don't wanna go outside tonight and in a pipe, she flies to the motherland or sells love to another man it's too cold outside for angels to fly angels to fly see ed sheeran liveget tickets as low as $48you might also like and they say she's in the class a team stuck in her daydream been this way since eighteen but lately, her face seems slowly sinking, wasting crumbling like pastries and they scream the worst things in life come free to us   an angel will die covered in white closed eye and hopin' for a better life this time, we'll fade out tonight straight down the line   and we're all under the upper hand and go mad for a couple grams and we don't wanna go outside tonight and in a pipe, we fly to the motherland or sell love to another man it's too cold outside for angels to fly [outro] angels to fly fly, fly for angels to fly to fly, to fly angels to die19",71.0
