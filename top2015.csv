Blank Space (Taylor's Version),Taylor Swift,"33 ContributorsTranslationsItalianoСрпскиTürkçeMagyarEspañolPortuguêsУкраїнськаFrançais日本語PolskiSvenskaDeutschSlovenščinaBlank Space (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
""Oh, my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?"" Ayy
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So, hey, let's be friends
I'm dyin' to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend
[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth thе pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tеll you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, mm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the king, baby, I'm your queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh, no
Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessin', like
""Oh, my God, who is she?""
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless (Oh)
We'll take this way too far

Or with a nasty scar

They'll tell you I'm insane (Insane)
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya

When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And darlin', I will be lovin' you till we're seventy
And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm thinkin' 'bout how
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well, me, I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am

[Chorus]
So honey, now, take me into your lovin' arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
And place your head on my beatin' heart, I'm thinkin' out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are

[Verse 2]
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mmm
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory

Do you recall, not long ago
We would walk on the sidewalk?
Innocent, remember?
All we did was care for each other
But the night was warm
We were bold and young
All around, the wind blows
We would only hold on to let go

Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on

King,Olly Alexander (Years & Years),"1 ContributorOlly Alexander LyricsI wanna marry
Olly Alexander! Olly Alexander! Olly Alexander!
Nobody better
Olly Alexander! Olly Alexander! Olly Alexander!

You tell me it’s a fantasy
You say he’ll never look at me;
But he’s already liked a picture on my Instagram
(Not to mention -)

In the middle of the night he comes to me in my wildest dreams
Reveals to me years and years its seemed
Life was going nowhere arе history
Cause the air, it shifts, when wе’re together
Olly Alexander
And Me

I wanna marry
Olly Alexander! Olly Alexander! Olly Alexander!
I wanna marry
Olly Alexander! Olly Alexander! Olly Alexander!
Monogamy’s a stranger
Olly Alexander! Olly Alexander! Olly Alexander!
But not forever
(or with) Olly Alexander! Olly Alexander! Olly Alexander!
You might also likeYou tell me that he’s awful busy
Got no time for a guy like me
But he already liked a picture on my Instagram
(And don’t forget that - )

In the middle of the night he comforts me, makes me feel pretty
We speak only complex poetry
And our love surrounds us, somehow tangibly
While the earth’s core cools when we’re together
Olly Alexander

He comes to me in my wildest dreams
I get on one knee,  look up at my King
Propose sweet nothings  I’ve been told may mean
""Can I be with you, my dear, forever
Olly Alexander""?

In the middle of the night we drive away
“Don’t look back,” he’ll say
He loves me so,  we're never letting go;
Dreams accelerate, yet all of time stands still
Cause it’s “Clockstoppers” when we’re together
Olly Alexander

She knows exactly how to tantalize
She's out to get you, danger by design
Cold-blooded vixen, she don't compromise

So far from typical, but take my advice
Before you play with fire, do think twice
And if you get burned, don't be surprised

Like I Can,Sam Smith,"62 ContributorsTranslationsFrançaisLike I Can Lyrics[Verse 1]
He could be a sinner or a gentleman
He could be a preacher when your soul is damned
He could be a lawyer on a witness stand
But he'll never love you like I can, can
He could be a stranger you gave a second glance
He could be a trophy of a one night stand
He could have your humour, but I don't understand
'Cause he'll never love you like I can, can, can

[Chorus]
Why are you looking down all the wrong roads?
When mine is the heart and the salt of the soul
There may be lovers who hold out their hands
But they’ll never love you like I can, can, can
They'll never love you like I can, can

[Verse 2]
A chance encounter of circumstance
Baby, he's a mantra, keeps your mind entranced
He could be the silence in this mayhem, but then again
He’ll never love you like I can, can, can

[Chorus]
Why are you looking down all the wrong roads?
When mine is the heart and the salt of the soul
There may be lovers who hold out their hands
But they’ll never love you like I can, can, can
They'll never love you like I can, can, can

(Hey)

[Verse 1]
Once upon a younger year
When all our shadows disappeared
The animals inside came out to play
(Hey) Went face to face with all our fears
Learned our lessons through the tears
Made memories we knew would never fade

[Pre-Chorus]
One day my father he told me
""Son, don't let it slip away""
He took me in his arms, I heard him say (Hey)
""When you get older
Your wild heart will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid""

[Chorus]
He said, ""One day you'll leave this world behind
So live a life you will remember""
My father told me when I was just a child

You were talkin' deep like it was mad love to you
You wanted my heart, but I just liked your tattoos
Poured it down, so I poured it down

All the girls on the block knocking at my door
Wanna know what it is, make the boys want more

[Verse 1: Perrie, Jade, All]
Is your lover playing on your side?
Said he loves ya, but he ain't got time
Here's the answer, come and get it
At a knocked down price (Hey!)
Full of honey just to make him sweet
Crystal balling just to help him see
What he's been missing, so come and get it
While you've still got time (Hey!)

[Pre-Chorus: Leigh-Anne]
Get your boy on his knees
And repeat after me, say

[Chorus: All, Jade]
Take a sip from my secret potion, I'll make you fall in love
For a spell that can't be broken, one drop should be enough
Boy, you belong to me, I got the recipe
And it's called black magic (And it's called black magic, yeah)
Take a sip from my secret potion, one taste and you'll be mine
It's a spell that can't be broken, it'll keep you up all night
Boy, you belong to me, I got the recipe
And it's called black magic (And it's called black magic, yeah)

Are you ready?
Ha

[Verse 1]
It's time for me to take it, I'm the boss right now
Not gonna fake it, not when you go down
'Cause this is my game
And you better come to play (Come to play)
I used to hold my freak back, now I'm lettin' go
I make my own choice, bitch, I run this show (Bitch)
So leave the lights on
No, you can't make me behave (Ha, ha, ha)

[Pre-Chorus]
(Oh-oh-oh)
So, you say I'm complicated
That I must be out my mind
But you've had me underrated, rated, rated (Uh-huh)

What's wrong with bein', what's wrong with bein'
What's wrong with bein' confident? (Uh-huh)
What's wrong with bein', what's wrong with bein'
What's wrong with bein' confident? (Uh-huh)

[Pre-Chorus]

Waiting for the light to go
Don't you feel that hunger
I've got, so many secrets to show
When I saw you on that stage
I shiver with the look you gave
Don't you hear that rhythm
Can you show me how we can escape

[Pre-chorus:]
I was biting my tongue
I was trying to hide
I'll forget what I've done
I will be redefined

[Chorus:]
It's shaking the sky and I'm following lightning
I'll recover if you keep me alive
Don't leave me behind, can you see me, I'm shining
And it's you that I've been waiting to find

[2x]
I'm holding it all tonight
I'm folding it all tonight
You know that you make it shine
It's you that I've been waiting to find

Now that we can hear that sound
Now that you can hold me down
You can pull me under
You can raze everything to the ground
Everything I can arrange
Every part of me you change
Just hold me together
Tell me, you'll always want me to stay

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]

Wanna be the one you steal
I wanna be the one you shield
I wanna be the one that your love, that your love can heal
I wanna be the one you steal
I wanna be the one you shield
I wanna be the one that your love, that your love...

I think I've had enough
I might get a little drunk
I say what's on my mind
I might do a little time
'Cause all of my kindness
Is taken for weakness

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Now I'm four, five seconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm just tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
Ooh, that's all I want
[Verse 2: Kanye West & Paul McCartney]
Woke up an optimist
Sun was shinin', I'm positive
We can run
Then I heard you was talkin' trash
I'm on a mystery
Hold me back, I'm 'bout to spaz

[Chorus: Rihanna & Kanye West]
Yeah, I'm 'bout four, five seconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would try me
Ooh, that’s all I want
You might also like[Bridge: Rihanna]
And I know that you're up tonight
Thinkin', ""How could I be so selfish?""
But you called 'bout a thousand times
Wondering where I've been
Now I know that you're up tonight
Thinkin', ""How could I be so reckless?""
But I just can't apologize
I hope you can understand, yeah

[Verse 3: Kanye West with Rihanna]
If I go to jail tonight
Promise you'll pay my bail
See they want to buy my pride
But that just ain't up for sale
See all of my kindness (Mhm)
Is taken for weakness

[Chorus: Rihanna & Kanye West]
Now I'm four, five seconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
Ooh, that's all I want
Four, five seconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
Just tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would tell me

All My Friends (feat. Tinashe & Chance the Rapper),Snakehips,"95 ContributorsAll My Friends Lyrics[Intro: Tinashe]
Uh-huh, hoo

[Verse 1: Tinashe]
We open with the vultures, kissing the cannibals
Sure, I get lonely, when I'm the only
Only human in the heaving heat of the animals
Bitter, brown salt, stinging on my tongue, ah
Heart will not waver, heart will not wait its turn
It will beat, it will burn, burn
Burn your love into the ground with the lips of another
Do you get lonely? Sure, I get lonely sometimes
[Chorus: Tinashe & Snakehips]
All my friends are wasted
And I hate this club
Man, I drink too much
Another Friday night I've wasted
My eyes are black and red
I'm crawling back to your bed

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
I hate the bar (IGH!)
Pharmacy addict, hear the Wall Street traffic
Took the car (IGH!)
We reinvent the wheel just to fall asleep at it—skrrrt!
Crash on the floor, catch the z-z-z's (Hunh)
Popping the polar opposite of NZT (Hunh)
Hip-hop and the propaganda say they name-brand (Name-brand)
But I done seen how the *censored* did my main man (Main man)
The nights we won't remember are the nights we won't remember (IGH!)
I'll be gone 'til November, all my city call for Simba (IGH!)
Dreams are made for cages, nigga, lions are for real
Nigga, dying is for real, niggas dying off of pills (Woo!)
Nigga, fridays are for chill and I escaped the treachery
I just had to rest-in-peace the recipe
The rest of us are prayin' that the sand will leave a tan
If you're up right now, hope you hear what I'm saying
Hope you hear what I'm saying
You might also like[Chorus: Tinashe & Snakehips]

My eyes are black and red (Woo!)
I'm crawling back to your bed
[Bridge: Tinashe]
Do you get lonely? Sure, I get lonely, some nights
When the angels on my shoulder slumber and I'm stuck here
With the vultures, hissing and circling
You didn't call me (Call me, call me, call me)

[Pre-Chorus: Tinashe & Chance the Rapper]
Ooh, I'm crawling, crawling
Crawling back to you (IGH!)

[Chorus: Tinashe & Snakehips, Chance the Rapper, & All]
All my friends are wasted (All my friends are wasted)
And I hate this club
Man, I drink too much (Too much, I drink too much)

My eyes are black and red
I'm crawling back to your bed

Ghost Town,Adam Lambert,"57 ContributorsGhost Town Lyrics[Verse 1]
Died last night in my dreams
Walking the streets
Of some old ghost town
I tried to believe
In God and James Dean
But Hollywood sold out
Saw all of the saints
Lock up the gates
I could not enter
Walked into the flames
Called out your name
But there was no answer

[Chorus]
And now I know my heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town
My heart is a ghost town

[Verse 2]
Died last night in my dreams
All the machines
Had been disconnected
Time was thrown at the wind
And all of my friends
Had been disaffected
Now, I'm searching for trust
In a city of rust
A city of vampires
Tonight, Elvis is dead
And everyone's spread
And love is a satire

When We Were Young,Adele,"112 ContributorsTranslationsFrançaisفارسیالعربيةDeutschWhen We Were Young Lyrics[Verse 1]
Everybody loves the things you do
From the way you talk to the way you move
Everybody here is watching you
'Cause you feel like home, you're like a dream come true
But, if by chance, you're here alone
Can I have a moment before I go?
'Cause I've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're someone I used to know

[Pre-Chorus]
You look like a movie, you sound like a song
My God, this reminds me of when we were young

[Chorus]
Let me photograph you in this light in case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were before we realised
We were sad of getting old, it made us restless
It was just like a movie, it was just like a song

[Verse 2]

No, it's nothing wrong with me
The kids are all wrong, the story's all off

Come on, come on and let me in
Bruises on your thighs like my fingerprints
And this is supposed to match the darkness that you felt
I never meant for you to fix yourself

Let It Go,James Bay,"100 ContributorsTranslationsPortuguêsLet It Go Lyrics[Verse 1]
From walking home and talking loads
To seeing shows in evening clothes with you
From nervous touch and getting drunk
To staying up and waking up with you

[Pre-Chorus]
Now we're slipping near the edge
Holding something we don't need
All this delusion in our heads
Is gonna bring us to our knees

[Chorus]
So, come on, let it go, just let it be
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
Everything that's broke, leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
And I'll be me

[Verse 2]
From throwing clothes across the floor
To teeth and claws and slamming doors at you
If this is all we're living for
Why are we doing it, doing it, doing it anymore?

When we're becoming something else

[Produced by Pop & Oak and Sebastian Kole]

[Intro: Isaac Hayes]
I guess right now you've got the last laugh

[Verse 1]
I'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listenin' or I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it
But really, I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room with people who don't even care about my well-being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend
So, you can go back, please, enjoy your party
I'll be here, somewhere in the corner
Under clouds of marijuana with this boy who's hollerin'
I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to and I don't wanna get with you
So, tell my friends that I'll be over here

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh, here, oh-oh-oh, here
Oh-oh-oh, I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh, here, oh-oh-oh, here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
You might also like[Verse 2]
Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An anti-social pessimist, but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best
And your intentions aren't to bother me, but honestly, I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people, we can kick it and just listen to
Some music with a message, like we usually do
And we'll discuss our big dreams, how we plan to take over the planet
So, pardon my manners, I hope you'll understand that I'll be here
Not there in the kitchen
With the girl who's always gossipin' about her friends
So, tell them I'll be here
Right next to the boy who's throwin' up
'Cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God, why am I here?

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh, here, oh-oh-oh, here
Oh-oh-oh, I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh, here, oh-oh-oh, here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up out of here
[Bridge]
Hours later, congregatin' next to the refrigerator
Some girl talkin' 'bout her haters, she ain't got none
How did it ever come to this? I should've never come to this
So holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm stand-offish, don't want what you're offerin'
And I'm done talkin', awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standin' by the TV with my beanie low
Yo, I'll be over here
[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh, here, oh-oh-oh, here

Found out I was comin', sent your friends home
Keep on tryna hide it, but your friends know

I see a darkness in my fate

Come on, show me that you are down

[Verse 1]
For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl, for goodness' sake
You think I'm cryin' on my own, well, I ain't

[Refrain]
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

[Pre-Chorus]
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

[Chorus]
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care

Did you have to ruin
What was shiny? Now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me
Where I'm weak? Baby, I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound like you're laughin' right at me

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

[Chorus]
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood, hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut

Can make a heart open

Everybody's worried about me

Be damned if I let him catch up

I am on a whole 'nother level
Girl, he only fucked you over 'cause you let him
Fuck him, girl, I guess he didn't know any better
Girl, that man didn't show any effort
Do all I can just to show you you're special
Certain it's your love that holds me together
Lately you say he been killin' the vibe
Gotta be sick of this guy
Pull up, skrr, get in the ride
Left hand is steerin' the other is grippin' your thigh
Light up a spliff and get high

I got a bone to pick
I don't want you monkey-mouth motherfuckers
Sittin' in my throne again
Ayy, ayy, nigga, what's happenin'?
K-Dot back in the hood, nigga!
I'm mad (He mad!), but I ain't stressin'
True friends, one question

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
The yam is the power that be
You can smell it when I'm walkin' down the street
(Oh yes, we can, oh yes, we can)
I can dig rappin', but a rapper with a ghostwriter?
What the fuck happened? (Oh no!)
I swore I wouldn't tell, but most of y'all sharing bars
Like you got the bottom bunk in a two-man cell (A two-man cell)
Something's in the water (Something's in the water)
And if I gotta brown-nose for some gold
Then I'd rather be a bum than a motherfuckin' baller (Oh yeah!)

The yam brought it out of Richard Pryor
Manipulated Bill Clinton with desires

Just to go back to the hood, see my enemy, and say… (Oh yeah)

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
You goat-mouth mammyfucker
I was gonna kill a couple rappers, but they did it to themselves
Everybody's suicidal, they ain't even need my help
This shit is elementary, I'll probably go to jail
If I shoot at your identity and bounce to the left
Stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin', ""Compton!""
I should probably run for mayor when I'm done, to be honest
And I put that on my momma and my baby boo too
Twenty million walkin' out the court buildin', woo-woo!
Aw, yeah, fuck the judge
I made it past twenty-five, and there I was
A little nappy-headed nigga with the world behind him
Life ain't shit but a fat vagina
Screamin', ""Annie, are you okay? Annie, are you okay?""
Limo tinted with the gold plates
Straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast
From a peasant to a prince to a motherfuckin' king (Oh yeah)

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'—*Gunshot*
By the time you hear the next pop
The funk shall be within you—*Gunshot*
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'

But I'ma have a good time ballin' tonight
Tell the bartender, ""Line up some shots""
'Cause I'ma get loose tonight
She's on fire, she's so hot
I'm no liar, she burned up the spot
Look like Mariah, I took another shot
And told her drop, drop, drop, drop it like it's hot
Dirty talk (Hey), dirty dance (Hey)
She a freaky girl (Hey) and I'm a freaky man (Hey)
She on the rebound, broke up with her ex
And I'm like Rodman, ready on deck

I ran out the door to get her
She was holding hands with Trevor
Not the greatest feeling ever
Said, ""Pull yourself together
You should try your luck with Heather""
Then I heard they slept together
Oh, the less I know the better
The less I know the better

[Chorus]
Oh, my love, can't you see yourself by my side?
No surprise, leanin' on his shoulder like every night
Oh, my love, can't you see that you're on my mind?
Don't suppose you could convince your lover to change his mind
So goodbye

[Verse 2]
She said, ""It's not now or never
Wait ten years, we'll be together""
I said, ""Better late than never
Just don't make me wait forever""
Don't make me wait forever

Fast Car,Jonas Blue,"49 ContributorsFast Car Lyrics[Intro]
Oh, woah, oh
Oh, oh

[Verse 1]
You got a fast car
I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we will make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Starting from zero, got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I got nothing to prove
You got a fast car
And I got a plan to get us out of here
I've been working at a convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
We won't have to drive too far
Just across the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
And finally see what it means to be living

[Pre-Chorus]
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
We leave tonight or live and die this way
See Jonas Blue LiveGet tickets as low as $59You might also like[Chorus]
So I remember we were driving, driving in your car
The speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I, I had a feeling that I belonged
And I, I had a feeling that I could be someone
Had a feeling that I could be someone

[Verse 2]
You see, my old man's got a problem
He lives with the bottle, that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
I say, his body's too young to look like his
My mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said, somebody's got to take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did
You got a fast car
And we go cruising to entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
And I work in a market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs
[Pre-Chorus]
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
We leave tonight or live and die this way

Where there's a will, there's a way, kinda beautiful
And every night has its day, so magical

In every lost soul the bones of a miracle
For every dreamer a dream we're unstoppable

If you're not the one for me
Then how come I can bring you to your knees?
If you're not the one for me
Why do I hate the idea of being free?
And if I'm not the one for you
You've gotta stop holdin' me the way you do
Oh, honey, if I'm not the one for you
Why have we been through what we have been through?

[Pre-Chorus]
It's so cold out here (Here, here, here)
In your wilderness (Eh, eh, eh)
I want you to be my keeper (Eh, eh, eh)
But not if you are so reckless

[Chorus]
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge

That's the way it was
Happened so naturally
I did not know it was love
The next thing I felt was you
Holding me close
What was I gonna do?
I let myself go

And now we're flyin' through the stars
I hope this night will last forever
Oh-whoa-oh-oh

Ain't nobody
Loves me better
Makes me happy
Makes me feel this way
Ain't nobody
Loves me better than you

[Verse 2: Jasmine Thompson]
I've been waitin' for you

I knew just what I would do
When I heard your song
You filled my heart with a kiss
You gave me freedom
You knew I could not resist
I needed someone

My lover's got humour
She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshipped her sooner
If the heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's gettin' more bleak
A fresh poison each week
We were born sick, you heard them say it
My church offers no absolutes
She tells me, ""Worship in the bedroom""
The only heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you
I was born sick, but I love it
Command me to be well

[Pre-Chorus]
A, amen
Amen, amen

[Chorus]
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life

What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starvin' faithful
That looks tasty, that looks plenty
This is hungry work

There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene

Sorry,Justin Bieber,"198 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolPortuguêsFrançaisDeutschالعربيةSorry Lyrics[Written by Julia Michaels, Justin Tranter, and Justin Bieber]

[Verse 1]
You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try, but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?
'Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
And by once or twice, I mean maybe a couple of hundred times
So let me, oh, let me redeem, oh, redeem, oh, myself tonight
'Cause I just need one more shot at second chances

[Chorus]
Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Oh, is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's comin' from?
I'd make a candle out of it, if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one
It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes, homegrown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam

I might never be your knight in shinin' armour
I might never be the one you take home to mother
And I might never be the one who brings you flowers
But I can be the one, be the one tonight

[Pre-Chorus: Liam]
When I first saw you from across the room
I could tell that you were curious, oh, yeah
Girl, I hope you're sure what you're looking for
'Cause I'm not good at making promises

[Chorus: Harry, All]
But if you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms
And if you like having secret little rendezvous
If you like to do the things you know that we shouldn't do
Then, baby, I'm perfect
Baby, I'm perfect for you
And if you like midnight driving with the windows down
And if you like goin' places we can't even pronounce
If you like to do whatever you've been dreamin' about
Then, baby, you're perfect
Baby, you're perfect
So let's start right now

[Verse 2: Niall]
I might never be the hands you put your heart in
Or the arms that hold you any time you want them
But that don't mean that we can't live here in the moment
'Cause I can be the one you love from time to time

Nah, nah, honey, I'm good
I could have another but I probably should not
I got somebody at home, home, home, home

It's been a long night here and a long night there
And these long, long legs are damn near everywhere
Hold up now
You look good, I will not lie
But if you ask where I'm staying tonight, I gotta be like
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh baby, nah, baby
You got me all wrong, baby
My baby's already got all of my love

So nah, nah, honey, I'm good
I could have another but I probably should not
I got somebody at home and if I stay I might not leave alone

I'll keep you safe, I'll keep you sound
Right now it's pretty crazy
And I don't know how to stop or slow it down

Hey
I know there are some things we need to talk about
And I can't stay

Take a piece of my heart
And make it all your own
So when we are apart
You'll never be alone
You'll never be alone
