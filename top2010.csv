But every time she asks me, ""Do I look okay?""

Love The Way You Lie,Eminem,"362 ContributorsTranslationsTürkçeEspañolPortuguêsΕλληνικάFrançaisالعربيةDeutschLove the Way You Lie Lyrics[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffin' paint and I love her, the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
She fuckin' hates me, and I love it — ""Wait!
Where you going?"" — ""I'm leaving you!"" — ""No, you ain't!
Come back!"" — We're runnin' right back, here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good, it's goin' great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snapped, ""Who's that dude?"", I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em?
You meet, and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah, them chills, used to get 'em
Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em?
You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face
Spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em
So lost in the moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over, it controls you both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways
Guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over
But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane
[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
[Verse 3: Eminem]
Now, I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
When it comes to love, you're just as blinded, baby, please
Come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
Next time? There won't be no next time!
I apologize, even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her
To the bed and set this house on fire, just gonna—

You think I'm pretty without any makeup on
You think I'm funny when I tell the punch line wrong
I know you get me, so I let my walls come down, down
Before you met me, I was alright
But things were kinda heavy, you brought me to life
Now every February, you'll be my Valentine, Valentine

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's go all the way tonight
No regrets, just love
We can dance until we die
You and I, we'll be young forever

[Chorus]
You make me feel like I'm livin' a teenage dream
The way you turn me on, I can't sleep
Let's run away and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back
My heart stops when you look at me
Just one touch, now, baby, I believe
This is real, so take a chance and don't ever look back
Don't ever look back

[Verse 2]
We drove to Cali and got drunk on the beach
Got a motel and built a fort out of sheets
I finally found you, my missing puzzle piece

Tryna creep a little sneak peek (What? What? What?  At us)

To go back to a place much simpler than this
'Cause after all the partyin' and smashin' and crashin'
And all the glitz and the glam and the fashion
And all the pandemonium and all the madness
There comes a time where you fade to the blackness
And when you starin' at that phone in your lap
And you hopin', but them people never call you back
But that's just how the story unfolds
You get another hand soon after you fold
And when your plans unravellin', they're sayin'
""What would you wish for if you had one chance?""
So airplane, airplane, sorry, I'm late
I'm on my way, so don't close that gate
If I don't make that, then I switch my flight

Then maybe, oh, maybe I'll go back to the days (Days)

And back when ain't nobody listen to my mixtape
And back before I tried to cover up my slang

There's a stranger in my bed
There's a pounding in my head
Glitter all over the room
Pink flamingos in the pool
I smell like a minibar
DJ's passed out in the yard
Barbies on the barbecue
This a hickey or a bruise?

[Pre-Chorus]
Pictures of last night ended up online
I'm screwed, oh well
It's a blacked-out blur, but I'm pretty sure it ruled
Damn

[Chorus]
Last Friday night, yeah, we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots, think we kissed, but I forgot
Last Friday night, yeah, we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar, so we hit the boulevard
Last Friday night, we went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark then had a ménage à trois
Last Friday night, yeah, I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop-op, oh-woah

Trying to connect the dots
Don't know what to tell my boss
Think the city towed my car
Chandelier is on the floor
Ripped my favorite party dress
Warrant's out for my arrest
Think I need a ginger ale
That was such an epic fail

I'm thinkin' maybe I should get it out
And I don't wanna sound redundant, but I was wonderin'
If there was somethin' that you wanna know (That you wanna know)
But never mind that, we should let it go (We should let it go)
'Cause we don't wanna be a TV episode (TV episode)
And all the bad thoughts, just let 'em go
(Go, go, go, go, hey)

Billionaire (feat. Bruno Mars),Travie McCoy,"54 ContributorsBillionaire Lyrics[Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars]
I wanna be a billionaire so fucking bad
Buy all of the things I never had
I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
Oh, every time I close my eyes
I see my name in shiny lights, yeah
A different city every night, oh, I, I swear
The world better prepare for when I'm a billionaire

[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]
Yeah, I would have a show like Oprah, I would be the host of
Everyday Christmas, give Travie a wish list
I'd probably pull an Angelina and Brad Pitt
And adopt a bunch of babies that ain't never had shit
Give away a few Mercedes, like, ""Here, lady, have this""
And last but not least, grant somebody their last wish
It's been a couple months that I've been single so
You can call me Travie Claus minus the ho-ho
Aha, get it?
I'd probably visit where Katrina hit
And damn sure do a lot more than FEMA did
Yeah, can't forget about me, stupid
Everywhere I go, I'ma have my own theme music

[Verse 2: Travie McCoy]
I be playing basketball with the president
Dunking on his delegates
Then I compliment him on his political etiquette (Good job)
Toss a couple milli' in the air just for the heck of it (Woman)
But keep the fives, twennies, tens, and bens completely separate (Haha)
And yeah, I'll be in a whole new tax bracket
We in recession but let me take a crack at it
I'll probably take whatever's left and just split it up (There you go)
So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks (You too)
And not a single tummy around me
Would know what hungry was
Eating good, sleeping soundly
I know we all have a similar dream (Uh-huh)
Go in your pocket, pull out your wallet
And put it in the air and sing

[Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars & Travie McCoy]

Hi, my name is B.o.B, and I approve this message

[Chorus: Rivers Cuomo]
I got the magic in me
Every time I touch that track it turns into gold
Everybody knows I got the magic in me
When I hit the floor, the girls come snappin' at me
Now everybody wants some presto magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
Magic, magic, magic
Ahooooooo, I got the magic in me

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
These tricks that I'll attempt will blow your mind
Pick a verse, any verse, I'll hypnotize you with every line (Ah!)
I'll need a volunteer, how about you, with the eyes? (Right there)
Come on down to the front and stand right here and don't be shy (Bobby)
I'll have you time travellin', have your mind babblin'
People tryin' to inherit the skill, so they askin' me
Even David Blaine had to go and take some classes and
I see Mindfreak like ""What's up man, what's happenin'?"" (Mindfreak!)
So come one, come all, and see the show tonight (Ha)
Prepare to be astounded, no ghost or poltergeist
You know I'm no Pinocchio, I never told a lie

See, I deceive ya with my intergalactic ether (Yeah)
I sing just like Aretha, so respect me like I'm Caesar
I kick it like Adidas, flowin' sticky like adhesive
Be cautious, 'cause what I be on'll leave ya with amnesia

It's a spectacular show, 'cause my heart pumps diesel
So whatever you sayin', it don't entertain my ego
I do this everyday, Hocus Pocus is my steelo

Te Amo,Rihanna,"49 ContributorsTe Amo Lyrics[Verse 1]
""Te amo, te amo"", she says to me
I hear the pain in her voice
Then, we danced underneath the candelabra
She takes the lead
That's when I saw it in her eyes, it's over

[Chorus]
Then, she said ""Te amo""
Then, she put her hand around me waist
I told her no, she cried ""Te amo""
I told her I nah gon' run away
But let me go
My soul hears a cry
Without asking why, I said ""Te amo""
Wish somebody'd tell me what she said
Don't it mean ""I love you""?
Think it means ""I love you""
Don't it mean ""I love you""?

[Verse 2]
""Te amo, te amo"", she's scared to breathe
I hold her hand, I got no choice, uh
Pulled me out on the beach, danced in the water
I start to leave
She's begging me and asking why it's over

Listen, we can dance
But you gotta watch your hands
Watch me all night

Because I understand
That we all need love
And I'm not afraid
I feel the love, but I don't feel that way, no

We bring the women and the cars and the cards out
Let's have a toast, a celebration, get a glass out
And we can do this until we pass out
So we let it rain
Let it pour away (Yeah)
And we won't come down
Until we hit the ground and pass out (Pass out)

[Verse 1: Tinie Tempah]
Yeah, ah, yeah, I'm in charge now
I'm a star and I bought my fuckin' cast out
I live a very, very, very, wild lifestyle
Heidi and Audrina eat your heart out (Oh my gosh)
I used to listen to ""You don't wanna bring arms house""
I've got so many clothes, I keep some in my aunt's house
Disturbing London, baby, we about to branch out
Soon I'll be the king like Prince Charles' child, yeah
Yeah, yeah, and there ain't nobody fresher
Semester to semester, raving with the freshers
Twenty light bulbs around my table and my dresser
CLC Kompressor, just in case that don't impress her
Say hello to Dexter, say hello to Uncle Fester
Got 'em gazin' at my necklace and my crazy sun protectors

I've been Southampton but I've never been to Scunthorpe
I'm fuckin' crazy with the kicks, call me Jean-Claude
I'm 'bout to be a bigger star than my mum thought
'Cause every day I got a groupie at my front door
Now I drive past the bus I used to run for
Where's my fuckin' clap, where's my encore?
Uh, I walk alone, 'cause I was born alone
I chirps her just for fun, I'll never ever call her phone
I leave her in the club, I'll never ever walk her home
DL the fuckin' foundation, I'm the cornerstone
I'm fairly famous, I'm sorta known
And if your son doesn't, I bet your daughter knows
Check out my visual, check out my audio

POWER,Kanye West,"386 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolPortuguêsSvenskaFrançaisPOWER Lyrics[Produced by Andrew Dawson, Jeff Bhasker, Kanye West, Mike Dean & S1]

[Intro: Kanye West]
I'm living in that 21st century, doing something mean to it
Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it
Screams from the haters got a nice ring to it
I guess every superhero need his theme music

[Chorus: Kanye West]
No one man should have all that power
The clock’s ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I'm tripping off the power
(21st-century schizoid man)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
The system broken, the school's closed, the prison's open
We ain't got nothing to lose, motherfucker, we rolling
Huh? Motherfucker, we rolling
With some light-skinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands
In this white man world, we the ones chosen
So goodnight, cruel world, I'll see you in the morning
Huh? I'll see you in the morning
This is way too much, I need a moment

[Chorus: Kanye West]
No one man should have all that power
The clock's ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I'm tripping off the power
'Til then, fuck that, the world's ours
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
(21st-century schizoid man)

Fuck SNL and the whole cast
Tell them Yeezy said they can kiss my whole ass
More specifically, they can kiss my asshole
I'm an asshole? You niggas got jokes
You short-minded niggas' thoughts is Napoleon
My furs is Mongolian, my ice brought the goalies in
I embody every characteristic of the egotistic
He knows he's so fuckin' gifted
I just needed time alone with my own thoughts
Got treasures in my mind, but couldn't open up my own vault
My childlike creativity, purity, and honesty
Is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts
Reality is catching up with me
Taking my inner child, I'm fighting for custody
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me
As I look down at my diamond-encrusted piece

[Chorus: Kanye West]
Thinking no one man should have all that power
The clock's ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I'm tripping off the powder
'Til then, fuck that, the world’s ours
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
(21st-century schizoid man)
[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Colin Powells, Austin Powers
Lost in translation with a whole fuckin' nation
They say I was the abomination of Obama's nation
Well, that's a pretty bad way to start the conversation
At the end of the day, goddamnit, I'm killing this shit
I know damn well y'all feeling this shit
I don't need your pussy, bitch, I'm on my own dick
I ain't gotta power trip, who you goin' home with?
How Ye doing? I'm survivin'
I was drinkin' earlier, now I'm drivin'
Where the bad bitches, huh? Where you hidin'?
I got the power make your life so excitin'

[Outro: Kanye West & Dwele]
Now this will be a beautiful death
I'm jumping out the window, I'm letting everything go
I'm letting everything go
Mmm, now this will be a beautiful death
I'm jumping out the window, I'm letting everything go
I'm letting everything go
Now this will be a beautiful death
Jumping out the window, letting everything go
Letting everything go
You got the power to let power go?

The Suburbs,Arcade Fire,"56 ContributorsThe Suburbs Lyrics[Verse 1]
In the suburbs, I
I learned to drive
And you told me we'd never survive
Grab your mother's keys, we're leaving
You always seemed so sure
That one day we'd be fighting in a suburban war
Your part of town against mine
I saw you standing on the opposite shore
But by the time the first bombs fell
We were already bored
We were already, already bored

[Chorus]
Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm moving past the feeling
Sometimes I can't believe it
I'm moving past the feeling again

[Verse 2]
The kids want to be so hard
But in my dreams, we're still screaming
And running through the yard
And all of the walls that they built in the seventies finally fall
And all of the houses they built in the seventies finally fall
Meant nothing at all
Meant nothing at all, it meant nothing

[Verse 3]
So can you understand
That I want a daughter while I'm still young?
I want to hold her hand
And show her some beauty before this damage is done
But if it's too much to ask, if it's too much to ask
Then send me a son
Under the overpass
In the parking lot, we're still waiting, it's already passed
So move your feet from hot pavement and into the grass
'Cause it's already passed
It's already, already passed

Sak pasé!

[Verse 1]
I didn't mean to end his life, I know it wasn't right
I can't even sleep at night, can't get it off my mind
I need to get out of sight 'fore I end up behind bars
What started out as a simple altercation
Turned into a real sticky situation
Me just thinking on the time that I'm facing
Makes me wanna cry

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I didn't mean to hurt him
Coulda been somebody's son
And I took his heart when
I pulled out that gun
Rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum
Man down
Rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum
Man down

Oh, mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In Central Station
In front of a big ol' crowd
Oh, why?

Oh, mama, mama, mama

Don't know what I was thinking
Now he's no longer living

Written in the Stars (feat. Eric Turner),Tinie Tempah,"55 ContributorsTranslationsDeutschWritten in the Stars Lyrics[Chorus: Eric Turner]
Oh, written in the stars
A million miles away
A message to the main, oh
Seasons come and go
But I will never change
And I'm on my way
(Let's go!)

[Verse 1: Tinie Tempah]
Yeah, you're listenin' now
They say they ain't heard nothin' like this in a while
That's why they play my song on so many different dials
'Cause I got more fuckin' hits than a disciplined child
So when they see me everybody brrrap, brrraps
Man I’m like a young gun fully black Barack
I cried teardrops over the Massive Attack
I only make hits like I work with a racquet and bat
Look at my jacket and hat, so damn berserk
So down to earth, I'm bringin' gravity back
Adopted by the major, I want my family back
People work hard just to get all their salary taxed
Look, I'm just a writer from the ghetto like Malorie Blackman
(Where the hell's all the sanity at?) Damn
I used to be the kid that no one cared about
That's why you have to keep screamin' 'til they hear you out

[Verse 2: Tinie Tempah]
Yeah, I needed a change, when we ate, we never tipped
Because we needed the change, I needed a break
For a sec, I even gave up believing and praying
I even done illegal stuff and was leaded astray
They say that money is the root to the evilest ways
But have you ever been so hungry, it keeps you awake?
Mate, now my hunger would leave them amazed, great
It feels like a long time coming, fam
Since the day I thought of that cunning plan
One day I had a dream, I tried to chase it
But I wasn't going nowhere, running man
I knew that maybe someday I would understand
Tryna change a tenner to a hundred grand
Everyone's a kid that no one cares about
You just gotta keep screaming 'til they hear you out

Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We could do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
You be up on everything, other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever, I swear I can spend whatever on it
'Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up
She made me beg for it 'til she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time
I say, you the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the fuckin' best (Ayy), you the fuckin' best (Ayy)
You the best I ever had (Ayy), best I ever had (Ayy)

Put the key under the mat and you know I be over there (Yup)
I be over there, shawty, I be over there
I be hittin' all the spots that you ain't even know was there
And you don't even have to ask twice
You could have my heart or we could share it like the last slice
Always felt like you was so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinkin' that he met you in a past life
Sweatpants, hair tied, chillin' with no make-up on
That's when you're the prettiest
I hope that you don't take it wrong
You don't even trip when friends say
""You ain't bringin' Drake along?""
You know that I'm workin', I'll be there soon as I make it home
And she a patient in my waiting room
Never pay attention to the rumors and what they assume
And until them girls prove it
I'm the one that never get confused with, 'cause

Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted

When I get right, I promise that we gon' live it up
She made me beg for it 'til she give it up

Sex, Love, Pain, baby, I be on that Tank shit
Buzz so big I could probably sell a blank disc
When my album drop, bitches'll buy it for the picture
And niggas'll buy it too and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper, girl, the money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee 'cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes, but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffith theme song
And who told you to put them jeans on?
Double cup love, you the one I lean on
Feelin' for a fix, then you should really get your fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show, she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make your fuckin' bra strap pop
All up in your slot 'til a nigga hit the jackpot, I'm saying

Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Send me away with the words of a love song
Oh-oh, oh-oh

[Verse 1]
Lord, make me a rainbow, I'll shine down on my mother
She'll know I'm safe with you when she stands under my colors
Oh, and life ain't always what you think it ought to be, no
Ain't even gray, but she buries her baby

[Refrain]
The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

There's a boy here in town, says he'll love me forever
Who would have thought forever could be severed by

[Refrain]
The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time

So put on your best boys, and I'll wear my pearls

A penny for my thoughts—oh no, I'll sell 'em for a dollar
They're worth so much more after I'm a goner
And maybe then you'll hear the words I've been singin'
Funny when you're dead, how people start listenin'

Standing on the edge of forever
At the start of whatever
Shouting love at the world
Back then we were like cavemen
But we map the moon and the stars
Then we forgave them

[Pre-Chorus 1 - Robbie]
We will meet you where the lights are
The defendants of the faith we are
When the thunder turns around they’ll run so hard we’ll tear the ground away

[Gary]
You know no one dies
In these love drowned eyes
Through our love drowned eyes
We’ll watch you sleep tonight

Although no one understood
We were holding back the flood
Learning how to dance the rain
We were holding back the flood

There’s progress now

She said ""I love you boy I love you so""
She said ""I love you baby oh, oh, oh, oh, oh""
She said ""I love you more than words could say""
She said ""I love you ba-ay-ay-ay-ay-by""

[Verse 1]
So I said what you're saying girl it can’t be right
How you can you be in love with me
We only just met tonight
But she said ""But boy I loved you from the start""
When I first heard love goes down
Something started burning in my heart
I said ""Stop this crazy talk""
""Leave right now and close the door"" (she said…)

[Hook]
She said ""I love you boy I love you so""
She said ""I love you baby oh, oh, oh, oh, oh""
She said ""I love you more than words could say""
She said ""I love you ba-ay-ay-ay-ay-by""

[Verse 2]
So now I’m up in the courts pleading my case from the witness box
Telling the judge and the jury the same thing that I said to the cops
On the day that I got arrested, I’m innocent, I protested
She just feels rejected, had her heart broke by someone she obsessed with
Cos she likes the sound of my music
Which makes her a fan of my music
That’s why love goes down makes her lose it
'Cos she can't separate the man from the music
And I'm saying all this in the stand
While my girl cries tears in the gallery
This has got bigger then I ever could have planned
Like that song by the Zutons, Valerie
But the jury don’t look like they’re buying it
And this is making me nervous
Arms crossed, screw faced like I’m trying it
Their eyes fixed on me like a murderers
They wanna lock me up and throw away the key
They wanna send me down even though I told 'em she

I show my moves off now, everybody tryna do me (Jockin')
I leave the functions, and all the ladies tryna screw me (On me)
Now you just do you, and I'ma do me (All day)
Niggas love to hate, so they try to shoot me
Bitches be stuck to me, I think they try to glue me
I make the party shine bright when it started gloomin'
This beat was bubblegum, so I had to chew it

I-I-I-I can make your bed rock
I-I-I-I can make your bed rock

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Uh, she got that good-good, she Michael Jackson bad
I'm attracted to her, or her attractive ass
And now we murderers, because we kill time
I knock her lights out and she still shine
I hate to see her go but I love to watch her leave
But I keep her running back and forth; soccer team
Cold as a winter's day, hot as a summer's eve
Young Money thieves steal your love and leave

[Verse 2: Gudda Gudda]
I like the way you walking if you walking my way
I'm that Red Bull, now let's fly away
Let's buy a place, with all kind of space
I'll let you be the judge, and-and-and I'm the case
I'm Gudda Gudda, I put her under
I see me with her, no Stevie Wonder
She don't ever wonder, 'cause she know she bad
And I got her, nigga: grocery bag

[Verse 4: Drake]
I love your sushi roll, hotter than wasabi
I race for your love, ""Shake'n Bake"" Ricky Bobby
I'm at the W, but I can't meet you in the lobby
Girl, I gotta watch my back, 'cause I'm not just anybody
I seen em stand in line just to get beside her

[Verse 5: Tyga]
She like tanning, I like staying in
She like romance and I like rolling with friends
She said I'm caged in, I think her conscience is
She's watching that Oxygen, I'm watching ESPN
But when that show ends, she all over my skin, lotion
Slow-mo motions, rollercoastin'
Like back, forth, hold it
She poses like it's for posters and I poke like I'm suppose to
Take this photo if you for me, she said: ""Don't you ever show this!""
I'm too loyal and too focused
To be losing and be hopeless
When I spoke this, she rejoiced it, said ""Your words get me open""
So I closed it, where your clothes is?
I'm only loving for the moment
[Verse 6: Jae Millz]
She ain't got a man, but she's not alone
Miss Independent, yeah, she got her own
Hey gorgeous, um, I mean flawless, well
That's what you are, how I see it is how I call it, yeah
Look-look at how she walk, m-hmm, she know she bad
Do-do your thang baby, I ain't even mad

[Verso 1]
Ela é amiga da minha mulher
Pois é, pois é
Mas vive dando em cima de mim
Enfim, enfim
Ainda por cima, é uma tremenda gata
Pra piorar a minha situação

[Pré-Refrão]
Se fosse mulher feia, tava tudo certo
Mulher bonita mexe com meu coração
Se fosse mulher feia, tava tudo certo
Mulher bonita mexe com meu coração

[Refrão]
Não pego, eu pego
Não pego, eu pego
Não pego, não
(Não pego, eu pego)
(Não pego, eu pego)
(Não pego, não)

[Verso 2]
Minha mulher me perguntou até: ""Qual é, qual é?""
Eu respondi que não tô nem aí, menti, menti
De vez em quando, eu fico admirando:
""É muita areia pro meu caminhão""

Rapture - Avicii New Generation Mix,Nadia Ali,"6 ContributorsRapture (Avicii New Generation Mix) LyricsThe night I laid my eyes on you
Felt everything around me move
Got nervous when you looked my way
But you knew all the words to say

Then your love slowly moved right in
All this time, oh my love, where you been?

Mi amore don't you know
My love I want you so
Sugar you make my soul complete
Rapture tastes so sweet

Since we connect behind closed doors
Spark this fire even more
No telling where we will be next
Surrender to your rapture arrest

Lay your head, let the slumber float
Can't resist, that's why word were wrote, yeah

Remember December,Demi Lovato,"27 ContributorsTranslationsTiếng ViệtEspañolRemember December Lyrics[Verse 1]
I feel a separation coming on
'Cause I know you want to be moving on
I wish it would snow tonight
You'd pull me in, avoid a fight
'Cause I feel a separation coming on
Just prove that there is nothing left to try
'Cause the truth, I'd rather we just both deny
You kissed me with those open eyes
It says so much, it's no surprise to you
But I've got something left inside

[Chorus]
Don't surrender, surrender, surrender
Please remember, remember December
We were so in love back then
Now you're listening to what they say
Don't go that way
Remember, remember December
Please remember
Don't surrender

[Verse 2]
You just said that you wouldn't let them change your mind
'Cause when we're together, fire melts the ice
Our hearts are both on overdrive
Come with me, let's run tonight
Don't let these memories get left behind
You might also like[Chorus]
Don't surrender, surrender, surrender
Please remember, remember December
We were so in love back then
Now you're listening to what they say
Don't go that way
Remember, remember December
Please remember

[Bridge]

Rhinestone Eyes,Gorillaz,"123 ContributorsRhinestone Eyes Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm a scary gargoyle on a tower
That you made with plastic power
Your rhinestone eyes are like factories far away
When the paralytic dreams that we all seem to keep
Drive on engines 'til they weep
With future pixels in factories far away
So call the mainland from the beach
All parties now washed up in bleach
The waves are rising for this time of year
And nobody knows what to do with the heat
Under sunshine pylons, we'll meet
While rain is falling like rhinestones from the sky

[Instrumental Break]
(Uh, mm)
Uh
Mmm

[Verse 2]
I can't see you now my heart is frozen
All the verses and the corrosion
Have been after native in my soul
I prayed on the immovable
Yet clinging to the atoms of rock
Seasons see adjustment signs of change
I can't see now, she said, ""Taxi""
Now that light is all I can take
This dawn brings strange loyalties and skies
I'm a scary gargoyle on a tower
That you made with plastic power
Your rhinestone eyes are like factories far away

Same time every day, same routine
A clear target in the summer when skies are blue

It reverberates in my lungs

Hello, hello, baby, you called? I can't hear a thing

And now you won't stop callin' me, I'm kinda busy

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]

Somebody To Love,Justin Bieber,"32 ContributorsSomebody to Love Lyrics[Intro]
Oh, oh-oh

[Verse 1]
For you I'd write a symphony
I'd tell the violin, ""It's time to sink or swim""
Watch them play for ya
For you, I'd be, woah-woah
Running a thousand miles just to get to where you are
Step to the beat of my heart

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't need a whole lot, but for you I admit I
I'd rather give you the world or we can share mine
I know I won't be the first one giving you all this attention
Baby, listen

[Chorus]
I just need somebody to love
I don't need too much, just somebody to love
Somebody to love
I don't need nothing else, I promise, girl, I swear
I just need somebody to love

[Post-Chorus]
I need somebody, I-I need somebody
I need somebody, I-I need somebody
