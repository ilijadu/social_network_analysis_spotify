Love Me Harder,Ariana Grande,"127 ContributorsTranslationsPortuguêsFrançaisDeutschItalianoLove Me Harder Lyrics[Verse 1: Ariana Grande]
Tell me somethin' I need to know
Then take my breath and never let it go
If you just let me invade your space
I'll take the pleasure, take it with the pain

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
And if in the moment, I bite my lip
Baby, in that moment, you'll know this is
Somethin' bigger than us and beyond bliss
Give me a reason to believe it

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
'Cause if you want to keep me
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta
Got to love me harder
And if you really need me
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta
Got to love me harder (Lo-love me harder)

[Post-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Love me, love me, love me
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Harder, harder, harder

If you know about me and choose to stay
Then take this pleasure and take it with the pain

When I get you moaning, you know it's real
Can you feel the pressure between your hips?
I’ll make it feel like the first time

Swing my heart across the line
And in my face is flashing signs

Midnight
You come and pick me up, no headlights

Could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view, oh
It's been a while since I have even heard from you
(Heard from you)

[Pre-Chorus]
And I should just tell you to leave, 'cause I
Know exactly where it leads, but I
Watch us go 'round and 'round each time

[Chorus]
You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You got that long hair, slicked back, white T-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style

[Verse 2]
So it goes
He can't keep his wild eyes on the road, mmm
Takes me home
The lights are off, he's taking off his coat, mmm, yeah

I want you by my side

I hope they didn't get your mind
Your heart is too strong anyway
We need to fetch back the time
They have stolen from us

You've never danced like this before
We don't talk about it

Stoned in paradise

Coldest winter for me
No sun is shinin' anymore
The only thing I feel is pain
Caused by absence of you

I cannot find the way outta here

First things first, I'm the realest (Realest)
Drop this and let the whole world feel it (Let 'em feel it)
And I'm still in the Murda Bizness
I can hold you down, like I'm giving lessons in physics (Right, right?)
You should want a bad bitch like this (Huh?)
Drop it low and pick it up just like this (Yeah)
Cup of Ace, cup of Goose, cup of Cris
High heels, something worth a half a ticket on my wrist (On my wrist)
Taking all the liquor straight, never chase that (Never)
Rooftop like we bringing '88 back (What?)
Bring the hooks in, where the bass at?
Champagne spilling, you should taste that

Can't stand no haters, and honest, the truth is

And get my money on time, if it ain't 'bout money, decline
And swear I meant that there so much that I give that line a rewind
Said I get my money on time, if it ain't 'bout money, decline

But I got a feeling it's a feeling that's worth dying for
Just close your eyes and hold your breath because it feels right
We'll keep it moving till we make it to the other side
And let's enjoy the ride

I don't like walking around this old and empty house
So hold my hand, I'll walk with you, my dear
The stairs creak as you sleep, it's keeping me awake
It's the house telling you to close your eyes
And some days, I can't even dress myself
It's killing me to see you this way

This ship will carry our bodies safe to shore

We used to play outside when we were young
And full of life and full of love
Some days, I don't know if I am wrong or right
Your mind is playing tricks on you, my dear

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

[Verse 1: Vinz]
Am I wrong for thinkin' out the box from where I stay?
Am I wrong for sayin' that I choose another way?
I ain't tryin' to do what everybody else doin'
Just 'cause everybody doin' what they all do
If one thing I know, I'll fall, but I'll grow
I'm walking down this road of mine, this road that I call home

[Chorus: Vinz]
So, am I wrong? (Woo)
For thinkin' that we could be something for real?
Now, am I wrong?
For tryin' to reach the things that I can't see?
But that's just how I feel (Ooh, ooh)
That's just how I feel (Ooh, ooh)
That's just how I feel
Trying to reach the things that I can't see (Ooh, ooh)

[Verse 2: Nico]
Am I trippin' for having a vision?
My prediction, I'ma be on top of the world
Walk your walk and don't look back
Always do what you decide
Don't let them control your life
That's just how I feel, oh-ooh-woah
Fight for yours, and don't let go
Don't let them compare you, no
Don't worry, you're not alone

Ooh, girl, you're shining like a 5th Avenue diamond
And they don't make you like they used to, you're never going out of style
Ooh, pretty baby, this world might have gone crazy
The way you saved me, who could blame me when I just wanna make you smile?

Thinking I was born in the wrong time
One of a kind, living in a world gone plastic
Baby, you're so classic (Yeah, yeah, so classic)
Baby, you're so classic (Yeah, baby you)
Baby, you're so classic

[Verse 2: Tony Oller, with Malcolm Kelley]

When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And darlin', I will be lovin' you till we're seventy
And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm thinkin' 'bout how
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well, me, I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am

[Chorus]
So honey, now, take me into your lovin' arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
And place your head on my beatin' heart, I'm thinkin' out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are

[Verse 2]
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mmm
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory

All the kicks and all the blows
He won't ever let it show
Because he's stronger than you know
A heart of steel starts to grow

Gonna love ya, gonna love ya

This twisted cat and mouse game always starts the same
First we're both down to play, then somehow you go astray
We went from nothin' to something, liking to lovin'
It was us against the world, and now we just fucking?
It's like I loved you so much, and now I just hate you
Feelin' stupid for all the time that I gave you
I wanted all or nothin' for us, ain't no place in between
Might, might be me believin' what you say that you'll never mean
Like it'll last forever, but now forever ain't as long
If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't be stuck singin' this song
You were different from my last, but now you got 'em mirrored
And as it all plays out, I see it couldn't be clearer, now sing

Boy toy named Troy used to live in Detroit
Bi-bi-big dope dealer money, he was gettin' some coins
Wa-wa-was in shootouts with the law but he live in a palace
Bo-bought me, Alexander McQueen, he was keepin' me stylish
Now that's real, real, real
Gun in my purse, bitch, I came dressed to kill
Who-who-who-who wanna go first?, I had 'em pushin' daffodils
I-I-I'm high as hell, I only took a half a pill
I'm on some dumb shit

Keep watching over Durin's sons

If this is to end in fire, then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Callin' out, Father, oh, stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside (High)
And if we should die tonight, we should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
Callin' out, Father, oh, prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside
Desolation comes upon the sky

Now I see fire inside the mountain
And I see fire burning the trees
And I see fire hollowin' souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

Oh, should my people fall, then surely I'll do the same

Not a footprint to be seen
A kingdom of isolation
And it looks like I'm the queen

The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside
Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I tried!

Don't let them in, don't let them see
Be the good girl you always have to be
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
Well, now they know!

Let it go, let it go
Can't hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn away and slam the door!

I don't care
What they're going to say
Let the storm rage on
The cold never bothered me anyway!

It's funny how some distance
Makes everything seem small
And the fears that once controlled me
Can't get to me at all!

It's time to see what I can do
To test the limits and break through
No right, no wrong, no rules for me I'm free!

Let it go, let it go
I am one with the wind and sky
Let it go, let it go
You'll never see me cry!

Here I stand
And here I'll stay
Let the storm rage on!

My power flurries through the air into the ground
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast
I'm never going back
The past is in the past!

Let it go, let it go
And I'll rise like the break of dawn
Let it go, let it go
That perfect girl is gone!

Here I stand
In the light of day
Let the storm rage on
The cold never bothered me anyway!",74
Ugly Heart,G.R.L.,"26 ContributorsUgly Heart Lyrics[Verse 1: Simone Battle]
Maybe I'm just crazy, maybe I'm a fool
Maybe I don't know how to love, but maybe I do
Maybe you know more than me, but this much is true
This little heart and brain of mine say we're through with you

[Pre-Chorus: Emmalyn Estrada]
And I wonder does it blow your mind?
That I'm leaving you far behind
I wonder does it stop your heart to know
You're not my sunshine, anymore

[Chorus: All]
Okay, you're pretty, your face is a work of art
Your smile could light up New York City after dark
Okay, you're Cover Boy pretty, stamped with a beauty mark
But it's such a pity, a boy so pretty
With an ugly heart

[Verse 2: Lauren Bennett]
Maybe you'll get married, and she will kiss your feet
While I give all my rides away, I won't lose no sleep
Maybe on your honeymoon you'll think of me
But if you don't, won't shed a tear, yeah I can guarantee

So let’s break right out of these gilded cages
We’re going to make it now
Don’t ever turn around

There ain’t no reason to stay
We’ll be light years away

Drives you insane

[Verse 1]
Some people want me to be heads or tails
I say no way, try again another day
I should be happy, not tipping the scales
I just won't play letting my life get away

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm no fool, no, I'm not a follower
I don't take things as they come
If they bring me down
Life can be cruel if you're a dreamer
I just wanna have some fun
Don't tell me what could be done

[Chorus]
You know you like it, but it drives you insane
You know you like it, but it drives you insane
You know you like it, but you're scared of the shame

Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em, you ain't even

Don't tell 'em, don't tell 'em

[Verse 1: Jeremih]
Know you say you down with it
Won't tell 'em how you hit the ground with it
Girl, you know I'm from Chicago
I act a fool, Bobby Brown with it (In it)
Nobody take me out, though
You got gifts, bring 'em down the South Pole
Marathon doll gon' put in miles
Don't you worry 'bout him, I gon' work it out

Handcuff me to the bed, girl, it ain't no bailin'

Her nigga think she faithful, but she runnin' game

Amnesia,5 Seconds of Summer,"73 ContributorsAmnesia Lyrics[Verse 1: Calum]
I drove by all the places we used to hang out getting wasted
I thought about our last kiss, how it felt, the way you tasted
And even though your friends tell me you're doin' fine
Are you somewhere feeling lonely, even though he's right beside you?
When he says those words that hurt you, do you read the ones I wrote you?

[Pre-Chorus: Calum]
Sometimes I start to wonder, was it just a lie?
If what we had was real, how could you be fine?
'Cause I'm not fine at all

[Chorus: All, Luke]
I remember the day you told me you were leavin'
I remember the make-up running down your face
And the dreams you left behind, you didn't need them
Like every single wish we ever made
I wish that I could wake up with amnesia
And forget about the stupid little things
Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you
And the memories I never can escape
'Cause I'm not fine at all

[Verse 2: Calum, Calum & Luke]
The pictures that you sent me, they're still livin' in my phone
I'll admit I like to see them, I'll admit I feel alone
And all my friends keep asking why I'm not around
It hurts to know you're happy, yeah, it hurts that you moved on
It's hard to hear your name when I haven't seen you in so long

You made a vow, never get mad
You play the game, though it's unfair

It's not your house, where'd you go wrong?
First you get hurt, then you feel sorry

I know that we are upside down
So hold your tongue and hear me out

The Heart Wants What It Wants,Selena Gomez,"79 ContributorsTranslationsΕλληνικάFrançaisThe Heart Wants What It Wants Lyrics[Intro]
What the heart wants
What the heart wants
What the heart wants (Wants, wants, wants)

[Verse 1]
You got me sipping on something
I can't compare to nothing I've ever known
I'm hoping that after this fever I'll survive
I know I'm acting a bit crazy
Strung out, a little bit hazy
Hand over heart, I'm praying
That I'm gonna make it out alive

[Pre-Chorus]
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

[Chorus]
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
You might also like[Verse 2]
You got me scattered in pieces
Shining like stars and screaming
Lighting me up like Venus
But then you disappear and make me wait
And every second's like torture
Heroin drip, no more so
Finding a way to let go
Baby, baby, no, I can't escape

[Pre-Chorus]
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

[Chorus]
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

[Bridge]
This is a modern fairytale
No happy endings, no wind in our sails
But I can't imagine a life without
Breathless moments
Breaking me down, down, down, down
[Pre-Chorus]
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

[Chorus]
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

But she ain't have her ringer nor her ring on last night, ooh

Why give a bitch your heart when she'd rather have a purse?
Why give a bitch an inch when she'd rather have nine?
You know how the game goes, she be mine by halftime
I'm the shit, ooh

Birdman Junior in this bitch, no flamingos
And I done did everythin' but trust these hoes (Let me see)

Bed Of Lies,Nicki Minaj,"101 ContributorsBed of Lies Lyrics[Intro: Skylar Grey]
Oh-oh-oh, yeah

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
Do you ever think of me when you lie? (When you lie)
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies
And I knew better than to look in your eyes (In your eyes)
They only pretend you would be mine
And, oh, how you made me believe (Oh)
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie? (When you lie)
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
You could never make eye contact
Everything you got was based off of my contacts
You a fraud but I'ma remain icon-stat
Balenciagas on my boots with a python strap
You was caught up in the rush and you was caught up in the thrill of it
You was with me way before I hit a quarter mil' in it
Put you in the crib and you ain't never pay a bill in it
I was killin' it, now you got me poppin' pills in it
I told Baby hit you, I said, ""This nigga buggin'""
'Cause I was doin' it for us, I told 'em fuck the public
Couldn't believe that I was home alone, contemplatin' overdosin'
No more coastin', no more toastin' over oceans

Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
I just figured if you saw me, if you looked in my eyes
You'd remember our connection and be freed from the lies
I just figured I was something that you couldn't replace
But there was just a blank stare and I couldn't relate
I just couldn't understand and I couldn't defend
What we had, what we shared, and I couldn't pretend
When the tears rolled down, it's like you ain't even notice 'em
If you had a heart, I was hopin' that you would show it some
What the fuck you really tellin' me? What you tellin' me?
I could tell you lyin', get the fuck out, don't yell at me
I ain't mean to cut you, I ain't wanna catch a felony
This ain't How To Be A Player, you ain't Bill Bellamy
[Pre-Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
But there was something that I shoulda asked all along
I'ma ask on the song
[Bridge: Skylar Grey]
So does she know I've been in that bed before? (Bed before)
A thousand count and not a single thread of truth
If I was just another girl (Just another girl)
Then I'm ashamed to say that I'm not over you
There's one thing I need to know
So call me when you're not so busy
Just thinkin' of yourself (Thinkin' of yourself)

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
Do you ever think of me when you lie? (When you lie)
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies (Bed)
And I knew better than to look in your eyes (In your eyes)

Ignorin' everybody here, we wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now

I want you to be mine, lady
To hold your body close, take another step into the no-man's land
And for the longest time, lady

This love is ablaze, I saw flames from the side of the stage
And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
Until then, we've got nothin' to say and nothin' to know
But somethin' to drink and maybe somethin' to smoke
Let it go until our roads are changed
Singin' ""We Found Love"" in a local rave
No, I don't really know what I'm supposed to say
But I can just figure it out and then just hope and pray
I told her my name and said, ""It's nice to meet ya""
Then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know she's a keeper just from this one small act of kindness
I'm in deep **** if anybody finds out
I meant to drive home but I've drunk all of it now
Not soberin' up, we just sit on the couch
One thing led to another, now, she's kissin' my mouth

Don't,Ed Sheeran,"138 ContributorsDon’t Lyrics[Verse 1]
I met this girl late last year
She said, ""Don't you worry if I disappear""
I told her, ""I'm not really looking for another mistake""
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only lookin' for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me, ""I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around 10
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM""
Baby, if you wanted me then you should have just said, she's singin'

[Chorus]
Don't **** with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe

And for a couple weeks, I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before, a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's stayin' at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missin' it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissin' him, how I was confused about
Now, she should figure it out while I'm sat here singing

[Chorus]
Don't **** with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe
[Verse 3]
On my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was cryin' on my shoulder, I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next (Get lost)
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat (Get lost)
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were stayin' on the same **** hotel floor
And I wasn't lookin' for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realised what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late, if I'm honest
And all this time, God knows I'm singin'

Don't **** with my love

#SELFIE,The Chainsmokers,"90 ContributorsTranslationsPortuguêsEnglish#SELFIE Lyrics[Verse 1]
When Jason was at the table
I kept on seeing him look at me when he was with that other girl
Do you think he was just doing that to make me jealous?
Because, he was totally texting me all night last night
And I don't know if it's a booty call or not
So... like what do you think?
Did you think that girl was pretty?
How did that girl even get in here?
Did you see her?
She's so short, and that dress is so tacky
Who wears Cheetah?
It's not even summer, why does the DJ keep on playing ""Summertime Sadness""?
After we go to the bathroom, can we go smoke a cigarette? I really need one
But first, let me take a selfie

[Drop 1]
Let me take a selfie

[Verse 2]
Can you guys help me pick a filter?
I don't know if I should go with XX Pro or Valencia
I wanna look tan
What should my caption be? I want it to be clever
How about ""Living with my bitches, #LIVE""?
I only got ten likes in the last five minutes
Do you think I should take it down?

That's so ratchet
That girl is such a fake model
She definitely bought all her Instagram followers
Who goes out on Mondays?
Okay, let's go take some shots
Oh no, ugh, I feel like I'm gonna throw up
Oh wait, never mind, I'm fine
Let's go dance
There's no vodka at this table
Do you know anyone else here?
Oh my God, Jason just texted me
Should I go home with him?
I guess I took a good selfie

She don't feel the same about us in her bones
It seems to me that when I die
These words will be written on my stone
