Hate to give the satisfaction asking how you're doing now
How's the castle built off people you pretend to care about?
Just what you wanted
Look at you, cool guy, you got it
I see the parties and the diamonds sometimes when I close my eyes
Six months of torture you sold as some forbidden paradise
I loved you truly
You gotta laugh at the stupidity

[Chorus]
'Cause I've made some real big mistakes
But you make the worst one look fine
I should've known it was strange
You only come out at night
I used to think I was smart
But you made me look so naive
The way you sold me for parts
As you sunk your teeth into me, oh
Bloodsucker, fame fucker
Bleedin' me dry like a goddamn vampire
[Verse 2]
And every girl I ever talked to told me you were bad, bad news
You called them crazy, God, I hate the way I called 'em crazy too
You're so convincing
How do you lie without flinching? (How do you lie? How do you lie? How do you lie?)
Oh, what a mesmerizing, paralyzing, fucked up little thrill
Can't figure out just how you do it and God knows I never will
Went for me and not her
'Cause girls your age know better

[Bridge]
(Ah)
You said it was true love, but wouldn't that be hard?
You can't love anyone 'cause that would mean you had a heart
I tried to help you out, now I know that I can't
'Cause how you think's the kind of thing I'll never understand

[Chorus]
I've made some real big mistakes
But you make the worst one look fine

Fever dream high in the quiet of the night

Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh

No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you

Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine

(Pa' tipos como tú, uh-uh-uh-uh)

[Verso 1: Shakira]
Perdón, ya cogí otro avión
Aquí no vuelvo, no quiero otra decepción
Tanto que te las das de campeón
Y cuando te necesitaba diste tu peor versión
Sorry, baby, hace rato
Que yo debí botar ese gato
Una loba como yo no está pa' novato'

[Coro: Shakira]
Una loba como yo no está pa' tipos como tú, uh-uh-uh-uh
Pa' tipos como tú, uh-uh-uh-uh
A ti te quedé grande y por eso estás con una igualita que tú, uh-uh-uh-uh
Oh-oh, oh-oh

[Verso 2: Shakira]
Esto es pa' que te mortifique', mastique' y trague', trague' y mastique'
Yo contigo ya no regreso, ni que me llores ni me supliquе'
Entendí que no es culpa mía quе te critiquen
Yo solo hago música, perdón que te salpique
Me dejaste de vecina a la suegra
Con la prensa en la puerta y la deuda en Hacienda
Te creíste que me heriste y me volviste más dura
Las mujeres ya no lloran, las mujeres facturan

Take a look inside your heart, is there any room for me?
I won't have to hold my breath till you get down on one knee
Because you only want to hold me when I'm looking good enough
Did you ever feel me? Would you ever picture us?
Every time I pull my hair, well, it's only out of fear
That you'll find me ugly and one day you'll disappear because
What's the point of crying? It was never even love
Did you ever want me? Was I ever good enough?

Mm, she the devil

[Verse 2: Doja Cat]
Said pop make money, now you try, bitch
You could use a revamp with a new vibe, sis
I don't need a big feature or a new sidekick
I don't need a new fan 'cause my boo like it
I don't need to wear a wig to make you like it
I'm a two-time bitch, you ain't knew I'd win?
Throw a shot like you tryna have a food fight then
All my opps waitin' for me to be you, I bet
Said I got drive, I don't need a car
Money really all that we fiendin' for
I'm doin' things they ain't seen before
Fans ain't dumb, but extremists are
I'm a demon lord
Fall off what? I ain't seen the horse
Called your bluff, better cite the source
Fame ain't somethin' that I need no more
[Chorus: Doja Cat]
'Cause, bitch, I said what I said
I'd rather be famous instead
I let all that get to my head
I don't care, I paint the town red
Bitch, I said what I said
I'd rather be famous instead
I let all that get to my head
I don't care, I paint the town red

Mm, she the devil
She a bad lil' bitch, she a rebel
She put her foot to the pedal
It'll take a whole lot for me to settle
Mm, she the devil

Me hiciste daño, y así te extraño

Ando manejando por las calles que me besaste
Oyendo las canciones que un día me dedicaste
Te diría que volvieras, pero eso no se pide
Mejor le pido a Dios que me cuide
Porque ando manejando por las calles que me besaste

Que me cuide de otra que se parezca a ti
No quiero caer como hice por ti
Ojalá te enamore, te haga lo mismo que me hiciste a mí
Tú me enseñaste a no amar a cualquiera
Y también cómo no quiero que me quieran

It was just two lovers
Sittin' in the car, listenin' to Blonde
Fallin' for each other
Pink and orange skies, feelin' super childish
No Donald Glover
Missed call from my mother
Like, ""Where you at tonight?""
Got no alibi

[Pre-Chorus]
I was all alone with the love of my life
She's got glitter for skin
My radiant beam in the night
I don't need no light to see you

[Chorus]
Shine
It's your golden hour (Oh-oh-oh)
You slow down time
In your golden hour (Oh-oh-oh)

[Verse 2]
We were just two lovers
Feet up on the dash, drivin' nowhere fast
Burnin' through the summer
Radio on blast, make the moment last, she got solar power
Minutes feel like hours
She knew she was the baddest
Can you even imagine fallin' like I did?

For the love of my life
She's got glow on her face
A glorious look in her eyes

I don't need no light to see you

[Chorus]

It's your golden hour (Oh-oh-oh)

And I'm right here with all my friends

And I know we're done, I know we're through
But, God, when I look at you

Putting on my lip gloss
I saw you stare from my peripheral, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, it's been a hell of a day
But I know a place we can escape
Find out how it feels to let go of everything, be free
When you're here with me

[Chorus]
I just wanna get high with my lover
Veo una muñeca cuando miro en el espejo
Kiss, kiss, looking dolly, I think I may go out tonight
I just wanna ride, get high in the moonlight
I just wanna get high with my lover
Veo una muñeca cuando miro en el espejo
Kiss, kiss, looking dolly, I think I may go out tonight
I just wanna ride, get high in the moonlight

There's nothing like peace of mind
And you take the time to make sure that I'm okay
I know I can put stress on your brain

To show me that I'm your priority
Find out how it feels to let go of everything, be free

Kiss, kiss, looking dolly, I think I may go out tonight
I just wanna ride, get high in the moonlight

[Outro]
Get higher with you
Get higher and higher with you
Let's go to the moon
And leave behind all that
How does it feel, here by my side getting higher and higher?
Under the moonlight's glow
There's nowhere we won't go
Together go higher and higher
No-no-nowhere we won't go7Embed",8574702,"['benny blanco', 'Cashmere Cat', 'Kali Uchis']","['benny blanco', 'Cashmere Cat', 'Leon Michels']"

Lo que vivimos se me olvidó
Y eso e' lo que te tiene ofendido
Que hasta la vida me mejoró
Por acá ya no eres bienvenido
Vi lo que tu novia me tiró
Eso no da ni rabia, yo me río, yo me río

[Verso 2: KAROL G & Shakira]
No tengo tiempo pa' lo que no aporte, ya cambié mi norte

Lyrics[Intro: RAYE]
Sleazin' and teasin', I'm sittin' on him
All of my diamonds are drippin' on him
I met him at the bar, it was twelve or something
I ordered two more wines 'cause tonight, I want him

[Verse 1: RAYE]
A little context if you care to listen
I find myself in a shit position
The man that I love sat me down last night
And he told me that it's over, dumb decision
And I don't wanna feel how my heart is rippin'
In fact, I don't wanna feel, so I stick to sippin'
And I'm out on the town with a simple mission
In my little black dress and this shit is sittin'

[Pre-Chorus: RAYE]
Just a heart broke bitch, high heels six inch
In the back of the nightclub, sippin' champagne
I don't trust any of these bitches I'm with
In the back of the taxi sniffin' cocaine
Drunk calls, drunk texts, drunk tears, drunk sex
I was lookin' for a man who was on the same page
Now it's back to the intro, back to the bar
To the Bentley, to the hotel, to my old ways

'Cause I don't wanna feel how I did last night
I don't wanna feel how I did last night
Doctor, doctor, anything, please
Doctor, doctor, have mercy on me
Take this pain away
You're askin' me my symptoms, doctor, I don't wanna feel

[Verse 2: RAYE & 070 Shake]
Toke this joint how I'm blowin' this steam
Back to my ways like 2019
Not twenty-four hours since my ex did dead it
I got a new man on me, it's about to get sweaty
Last night really was the cherry on the cake
Been some dark days lately and I'm findin' it cripplin'
Excuse my state, I'm as high as your hopes
That you'll make it to my bed, get me hot and sizzlin'
If I take a step back to see the glass half-full
At least it's the Prada two-piece that I'm trippin' in
And I'm already actin' like a dick, know what I mean?
So you might as well stick it in (What?)

[Pre-Chorus: RAYE]
Just a heart broke bitch, high heels six inch
In the back of the nightclub, sippin' champagne
I don't trust any of these bitches I'm with
In the back of the taxi sniffin' cocaine
Drunk calls, drunk texts, drunk tears, drunk sex
I was lookin' for a man who was on the same page
Now it's back to the intro, back to the bar
To the Bentley, to the hotel, to my old ways
[Chorus: RAYE & 070 Shake]
'Cause I don't wanna feel how I did last night
I don't wanna feel how I did last night
Doctor, doctor, anything, please

Take this pain away
You're askin' me my symptoms, doctor, I don't wanna feel, mm (What?)

[Verse 3: 070 Shake & RAYE]
'Cause I don't wanna feel like I felt last night
I don't wanna feel like I felt last night
Be at peace with the things you can't change (Last night)
I'll be naked when I leave and I was naked when I came, yeah
Out of reach, out of touch
Too numb, I don't feel no way
Toast up, so what?
Street small, but it go both ways
So, you'll run, yeah
But you'll never escape
Sunset in the maze
(You're askin' me my symptoms, doctor, I don't wanna feel)

I don't wanna feel how I did last night
I don't wanna feel how I did last night, oh
Doctor, doctor, anything, please
Doctor, doctor, have mercy on me
You're askin' me my symptoms, doctor, I don't wanna feel
[Bridge: RAYE & 070 Shake]
I don't wanna feel how I did last night
I don't wanna feel how I did last night
How I did, how I did, how I did last night

[Outro: RAYE]
Mm, lipstick smudged like modern art
I don't know where the fuck I am or who's drivin' the fuckin' car
Speedin' down the highway, sippin'
Mixin' pills with the liquor cah fuck these feelings
I left everyone I love on read (Uh-huh)
Spilling secrets to the stranger in my bed (Uh-huh)

Think I gotta bond out again
Behind the tint, I sin, I vent

Right after you put that in my head
Do you still pop 'em? Do you dance?
Do you still drop some'? Know you can
I got a lot, but I'm still chancin'

Lyrics[Intro: Alexander 23]
One, two, three
Wait, is this the song with the drums?

[Verse 1]
I met a guy in the summer, and I left him in the spring
He argued with me about everything
He had an ego and a temper and a wandering eye
He said he's six-foot-two, and I'm like, ""Dude, nice try""
But he was so much fun, and he had such weird friends
And he would take us out to parties, and the night would never end
Another song, another club, another bar, another dance
And when hе said something wrong, he'd just fly me to Francе
So I miss him some nights when I'm feeling depressed
'Til I remember every time he made a pass on my friend
Do I love him? Do I hate him? I guess it's up and down
If I had to choose, I would say right now

[Chorus]
I wanna get him back
I wanna make him really jealous, wanna make him feel bad
Oh, I wanna get him back
'Cause then again, I really miss him, and it makes me real sad
Oh, I want sweet revenge, and I want him again
I want to get him back, back, back

So I write him all these letters, and I throw them in the trash
'Cause I miss the way he kisses and the way he made me laugh
Yeah, I pour my little heart out, but as I'm hitting ""send""
I picture all the faces of my disappointed friends
Because everyone knew all of the shit that he'd do
He said I was the only girl, but that just wasn't the truth
And when I told him how he hurt me, he'd tell me I was trippin'
But I am my father's daughter, so maybe I could fix him

[Chorus]
I wanna get him back
I wanna make him really jealous, wanna make him feel bad
Oh, I wanna get him back
'Cause then again, I really miss him, and it makes me real sad
Oh, I want sweet revenge, and I want him again
I want to get him back (And then? And then)
I want to get him back, back, back

Then be the one to stitch it up (But then I, I want to get him back; yeah)
Wanna kiss his face (But then I, I want to get him back)

SZA & Future (Русский перевод) Lyrics[Перевод песни Travis Scott — «TELEKINESIS» ft. SZA & Future]

[Интро: Future]
Раньше хотел трахнуть девушку из R&B, потом это случилось, е, е
Раньше хотел быть богатым, потом это наконец-то случилось
Думал, что это сделает меня счастливым (Думал, что это сделает меня счастливым)

[Куплет 1: Future]
Я мог бы взять боль на себя и ушел бы с позором
Улицы подняли меня, но у меня не было отца
Парни пытаются клонировать меня, украсть мой стиль
Продаю кокаин, на моей куртке Chanel (Куртка)
Малышка дает мне помыться с меньшим количеством, это не продлится (Не продлится)
Принимая еще больше наркотиков в одиночестве в особняке
Брожу по дому с пистолетом в руках (Брожу по дому с пистолетом)
Просто еще одна бедная шлюха, проповедующая за деньги (Ещё одна шлюха)
И я знаю, что меня ждет миллиардный аванс (У-ха)

[Припев: Travis Scott & Future]
Я могу видеть будущее, я могу видеть будущее (Я могу видеть будущее)
Я могу видеть будущее, выглядит так, будто мы пролетаем сквозь небо
Я не могу дождаться, чтобы жить в славе вечной жизни (Жить в славе)
Ты возьмешь руль? И я прилегу и сижу неподвижно
Так что лучше сейчас поднимайся, Он появится неожиданно
К трубам, нравится ли тебе звук? (Нравится ли звук?)

Нравится ли тебе звук? Ай
Я слышу твои мысли так громко, я слышу толпу так громко (Так громко)

[Бридж: Travis Scott & Future]
Я могу видеть будущее
Еду со Шторми, с Вольфом и несколькими бойцами
Прокатываюсь сквозь эту ерунду, эта ерунда глупая
Хожу по небу, как Люк, а
Уворачиваюсь от всех этих разговоров, словно Брюс, супер
Гуляю с моими ангелами, уклоняясь от Люцифера (Гуляю)
Вижу каждый угол, я могу видеть сквозь тебя, е (Е)

[Припев: Travis Scott & Future]
Я могу видеть будущее, выглядит так, будто мы пролетаем сквозь небо (Вижу тебя)
Я не могу дождаться, чтобы жить в славе вечной жизни (Жить в славе)
Ты возьмешь руль? И (Вижу тебя) я прилегу и сижу неподвижно
Так что лучше сейчас поднимайся, Он появится неожиданно
К трубам, нравится ли тебе звук?
Ты знаешь будущее баунса

[Рефрен: Future]
Считаю столько денег, пока моя кожа не отпадет
Вишнево-красный Бенц, как настоящий мачо (Е)
Мой брат готовит наркотики, для этого нужно настоящее мастерство
Делю свою сучку со своей шлюхой, мне не холодно (Нет)
Ты либо добиваешься денег, либо сплетничаешь (Е)
Она выбрала, надела это пальто, теперь у нее лотерея
[Куплет 2: Future]
Места, о которых я даже не думал, нашел моделей в них
Слышу демонов ясно, когда они зовут (Е)
Самый стильный на земле, поэтому я дал себе имя планеты (Pluto)
Автоматически мертв, когда ты идешь против моей семьи
Несколько разрывов стали публичными, я просто купил новую красавицу (Купил новую красавицу)
Телка знала, что я токсичен, когда познакомилась со мной, я был дикарём (Познакомилась, я был дикарём)
Высоко в горах, пытаясь избежать всех этих суматох (Е)
Личный на Lear, это как будто мы представляли
Продаю только Hi-Tech, потому что у меня нет Активиса (Е)
Я стараюсь быть скромным (Е), звучит, будто я хвастаюсь (Хвастаюсь)
Картье на моих оправах (Оправы), всё из-за моей известности (Известность)
Та сука сказала, что стыдно любить меня публично, предпочтет быть в тайне (Видел уже достаточно)

[Рефрен: Future]
Считаю столько денег, пока моя кожа не отпадет
Вишнево-красный Бенц, как настоящий мачо (Е)

[Бридж: SZA & Travis Scott]
Мне всё не хватает, я же говорила тебе, что просто хочу всего этого
Мне всё не хватает, ты делаешь недостаточно (Тебе нравится, как это звучит?)
Так холодно, так холодно
Здесь так холодно, так холодно, так холодно

[Куплет 3: SZA]
Ты можешь видеть будущее, в твоих глазах сверкает искорка
Почему ты так близко к моему бедру? Не могу тебе позволить
Типы замышляют мою смерть, у меня в мыслях убийство
У меня на кону деньги, я не проиграю, если попробую
Ни одна шлюха не сможет сбить меня с толку
Выбрана, я поставлю на себя
Выбрана, все мои вещи — старинные
Замерзаю, я не чувствую тепла
Бриллианты танцуют на мне
Ты начал с чистого листа, чувак, ты выбился из колеи
Ты трахнул ту девушку, с которой познакомился на вечеринке
У меня там новые парни в холле
Как я могу спать, когда ты убиваешь людей?
Я всё равно хочу быть с тобой, поверь, я знаю, что это безумие
Я бы предпочла трахаться с тобой, чем с какими-то лентяями
Я сделала что-то в Берлине, у меня передозировка
Мы оба ничтожны и это срабатывает для меня
Срабатывает для меня, да

Days ache and nights are long
Two years and still, you're not gone
Guess I'm still holding on
Drag my name through the dirt
Somehow it doesn't hurt though
Guess you're still holding on
You told your friends you want me dead
And said that I did everything wrong
And you're not wrong

Well, I'll take all the vitriol
But not the thought of you moving on

'Cause I'm not ready
To find out you know how to forget me

And pray to God that you never met me
Than forget me

I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room

[Pre-Chorus]
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
(Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)

[Chorus]
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

[Verse 2]
Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed

[Intro: Peso Pluma]
¡Ay!
¡Bi-Bizarrap!
¡Yee-hah-hah-ay!

[Verso 1: Peso Pluma]
Sigo aquí
Ando varias noches sin dormir
Estoy pedo, no te vo'a mentir
Le hablé a otra morrita al deducir que te perdí
Y ya no hay más
Cosas que contigo quiero hablar
Con otra piel yo te vo'a olvidar
De mi mente yo te vo'a sacar

[Coro: Peso Pluma]
Y ya nos verán pistear
Pura cadena gruesa y las plebitas son del Instagram
Diamantón llevo en mi Glock
Patek Phillippe es mi reloj (Wuh)
Yo sé qué tanto me costó
Y ahora navegamos por LA
Y pa' Sinaloa me voy también
Y las champañitas saben bien (Bien, eh)

Sigo aquí
Seguiré yo sin poder dormir
Todo ha cambia'o cuando te fuiste de aquí
Ya me prometí no repetir
Y ya será
Muy tarde pa' cuando quieras más
Tú solita tienes que aceptar
En mis brazos ya no vas a estar

[Verse 1: Central Cee]
I loved you until you try to get in my head
And that's why I lost respect
You're doin' the most to get my attention, baby, I'm not impressed, uh
I changed my bedsheets, but I still smell your flesh
I don't know how we got in this mess
I rarely get this in-depth
This girl make me question love
This girl make me feel like less of a man 'cause I'm feelin' depressed and stuff
Can't believe I was willing to drop everyone and invest in us
The last time that we fucked was fucked, the way you got up, got dressed and cut
Look, I thought that we could've been
Maybe, I was too optimistic
Tell me what you need, I'll provide everythin'
Baby, you don't know what you're missin'
Our chemistry felt like quantum physics, physics
Feelin' your energy, feelin' your spirit
If this is the end, I need one more visit
They're showin' me love, but I still feel empty
I need somethin' a lot more fulfillin', uh
Move out of London town then move to a rural village
You made me delete that pic off my phone
But I close my eyes, still see that image
Won't chase if my heart ain't in it, it's finished
Too far gone, can't fix it, bitch, this damage is done

You got a fast car
And I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Startin' from zero, got nothin' to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I got nothin' to prove

[Verse 2]
You got a fast car
And I got a plan to get us out of here
I've been workin' at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just across thе border and into the city
And you and I can both get jobs
Finally see what it mеans to be livin'

[Verse 3]
See, my old man's got a problem
He live in the bottle, that's the way it is
He said his body's too old for working
His body's too young to look like his
So Mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said, ""Somebody's gotta take care of him""
So I quit school and that's what I did

Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us and your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone

[Verse 4]
You got a fast car
We go cruising, entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
So I work in the market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
And we'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house, live in the suburbs

[Chorus]
So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us and your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone
[Verse 5]
You got a fast car
I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinking late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together you and me would find it
I got no plans, I ain't goin' nowhere
Take your fast car and keep on driving

[Intro: Drake]
Yo no sé, yo no sé qué les pasa a estas chicas
Siento que ellas no necesitan amor
Necesitan a alguien que pueda controlarlas
¿Sabes lo que ando diciendo? Te lo diré de bien a mal
Del quien es el inteligente y quien es el tonto
De qué utensilio usar para qué comida, como
Tengo un horario que cumplir aún
No podré realmente
6ix

[Verso 1: Drake]
Estas perras realmente se dejan llevar
Comеten errores y luеgo me ruegan que me quede
Me tienen molestando como si fuera el Arrogante Tae
Tienen mi mente en un lugar terrible
Azotada y encadenada como esclavos Americanos
Actuan como si no estuvieran acostumbrados a las estancias de Sheraton
Conocí al negro que pensaste que podría reemplazarme
¿Cómo se hicieron siquiera comparaciones?
Perra, la próxima vez, lo juro por la tumba de mi abuela
Te estaré adelgazando por las decisiones de niño que tomaste
Cruzándote, cruzándote, cruzándote
Ayy, esto no es lo más pequeño, podría seguir adelante en estas perras
Envié cables en cables sobre cables, como Idris
Tienes suerte de que no retiré lo que me dieron
Podría tenerte en un plan de pago hasta que tengas 150
Y mi slime está aquí, ella tiene algunas barras para todos estos negros
Así que retrocederé y dejaré que SZA hable sus mierdas por un minuto

Cruzándote, cruzándote, cruzando

[Verse 2: SZA]
Demonios, estos negros me tienen muy retorcida
¿Cómo carajo eres tan real, pero te haces la perra en mi línea?
Puedo sentir lo que estás gastando
Tengo mucho orgullo para dejar que ningún negro quemado me ensucie
Levántate, ve a montarte, en mi noche, tengo tiempo
Discutamos todas esas mentiras sobre
Manejar esto, como si me estuvieras jodiendo
Y ni siquiera voy a superarlo ahora
Y tú no te refieres a la mierda sobre la que rapeas
Y puedo girar a la puta, lo estoy aireando
Voy a seguir como si estuviera cortada
Tú le dices a estas putas que no estás abrazando
Pero conmigo ya sabes, haciendo toda esa mierda
Les estás diciendo a estas putas que no estás engañando
Pero conmigo ya sabes, lo sabré todo
¿Cómo se dejan llevar tanto los negros?
Equivocándose cuando ese pene apenas consigue el tercer lugar
Follado por lástima; es lindo que seas imbécil
Demonios, porque hay hombres que pueden fingir que les gusta el sexo

[Refrán: SZA]
Cruzándote, estoy cruzándote, estoy cruzando
Oh-woah, woah
[Verso 3: Drake]
Sí, Enero: finges ver la vida con claridad, cada año
Febrero es el momento en que dejas de lado el ojo malo y el orgullo
Por la fantasía de estar casandote; muy aterrador
Marzo ya te hizo dudar en segundos de los títulos
Abril: la Primavera está aquí y al igual que un resorte comienzas a girar en espiral
Mayo trae algunos días más cálidos
Junto a la piscina se pone muy bronceado
Junio te hace moverte helado, yendo y viniendo con un hombre casado
Julio fue cuando descubrí que tú mentiste
Agosto, era ""Bebé esto"", ""Bebé aquello"", como si tuvieras las trompas atadas
Septiembre: estamos cayendo, pero sigo siendo el hombre al que intentas conquistar
Octubre se trata de mí, porque tu turno debería haber acabado
Noviembre: tienes tu panel de humor para el próximo año y estás soltera
Diciembre es el regalo dando un mes y ahora quieres reavivarlo; yo
Intentas generar confianza, mostrándome tus MDs, de como intentan conquistarte
Es irónico cómo las noticias que recibí sobre ti terminaron siendo malas noticias
Ten a un negro disparado por cincuenta parrilladas, niña, la carne cuesta como si fuera Wagyu
Ten a un negro disparado, haré que su culo vea la luz, como una media luna
Saludo a QC, estoy bastante seguro de que hice P Ms como si fuera pasado el mediodía
Todo lo que realmente sé son Ws y Ms, la vida parece un baño
Todo lo que realmente sé son bolsas M, como si hubiera conducido y pedido comida rápida
Diciendo que soy demasiado cauteloso con mis sentimientos, ¿Quién carajo te preguntó?
Siete guardaespaldas, en caso de que alguien realmente quiera intentar colarse
No sé por qué te escucho cuando te oigo hablar conmigo, es una verdad a medias
Si no pago el alquiler, terminará como un viejo peinado, chica, eso es vencido
Si yo no—

Te-te-te pone caliente como la arena
Y ese culito blanco, el sol te lo ponga moreno
Lo tiene grandote por el entreno
Empieza el toque-toque, mojaíta'—

[Coro: Peso Pluma & KAROL G]
Qué hijueputa gana tengo de besarte
Te vi en una foto y te imaginé sin ropa
Te mentiría si no estoy loco por darte
Con ese jeancito cómo te ves de culona
Qué hijueputas ganas tengo de besarte
Te vi en una foto y te imaginé sin ropa
Te mentiría si no estoy loca por verte
Con ese jeancito cómo te ves de culona

[Refrán: Peso Pluma, KAROL G & Ambos]
Ayer te vi solita
Esa carita bonita
Diablo, qué mamacita
Estás provocándome aunque lo haces sin querer
Ya por ti pregunté y hace más de un mes
Te dejaste con el bobo aquel

Can we go back to how it was?
Before my pride got in between us
Go ahead and hit me where it hurts
Because at least, then I'll feel something

[Pre-Chorus]
Screaming in my face
Kicked me out your place
I got nowhere to go

[Chorus]
Can we find love again?
Is this time the end?
Tell me, how many more tears will drop
Till you hit me with ""Can we talk?""
And try love again
Can we find love again?
Is this time the end?
Tell me, how many more tears will drop
Till you hit mе with ""Can we talk?""
And try love again

[Verse 2]
I crashed my car into a wall
I triеd to text, I shoulda called
Seen blue and red, it won’t be long (Ooh, uh)
We went to war, it didn't end
I bit my tongue, you hit my chin
Worst enemy is my best friend (Ooh)

Lost a lil' weight, but I ain't never lost a tushy
Lookin' good, but now my bald head match my
Lookin' good, but now they all sayin' that I'm ugly
