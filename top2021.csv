Leave The Door Open,Bruno Mars,"193 ContributorsTranslationsTürkçeEnglishРусскийPortuguês日本語ItalianoDeutschNederlandsहिन्दीLeave The Door Open Lyrics[Intro: Bruno Mars]
Say baby, say baby, say baby

[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak & Bruno Mars]
What you doin'? (What you doin'?)
Where you at? (Where you at?)
Oh, you got plans? (You got plans)
Don't say that (Shut your trap)
I'm sippin' wine (Sip, sip) in a robe (Drip, drip)
I look too good (Look too good)
To be alone (Woo, woo)
My house clean (House clean), my pool warm (Pool warm)
Just shaved, smooth like a newborn
We should be dancin', romancin'
In the east wing and the west wing
Of this mansion, what's happenin'?

[Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars]
I ain't playin' no games
Every word that I say is coming straight from the heart
So if you tryna lay in these arms

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
I'ma leave the door open
(I'ma leave the door open)
I'ma leave the door open, girl
(I'ma leave the door open, hopin')
That you feel the way I feel
And you want me like I want you tonight, baby
(Tell me that you're comin' through)

Ooh, you're so sweet (So sweet), so tight (So tight)
I won't bite (Uh-uh), unless you like (Unless you like)
If you smoke (What you smoke?), I got the haze (Purple haze)
And if you're hungry, girl, I got filets (Woo)
Ooh, baby, don't keep me waitin'
There's so much love we could be makin' (Shamone!)
I'm talkin' kissin', cuddlin'
Rose petals in the bathtub
Girl, let's jump in, it's bubblin'

[Pre-Chorus: Bruno Mars]
I ain't playin' no games
Every word that I say is coming straight from the heart
So if you tryna lay in these arms (If you tryna lay in these arms)

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
I'ma leave the door open
(I'ma leave the door open)
I'ma leave the door open, girl
(I'ma leave the door open, hopin')
That you feel the way I feel
And you want me like I want you tonight, baby
Tell me that you're comin' through (Come on, girl)

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
Hey, hey, I'ma leave my door open, baby
(I'ma leave the door open)
I'ma leave, I'ma leave my door open, girl

And I'm hopin', hopin'

And you want me like I want you tonight, baby

Ooh

[Verse 1]
I saw you dancing in a crowded room (Uh)
You look so happy when I'm not with you
But then you saw me, caught you by surprise
A single teardrop falling from your eye

[Refrain]
I don't know why I run away
I make you cry when I run away

[Verse 2]
You could've asked me why I broke your heart
You could've told me that you fell apart
But you walked past me like I wasn't there
And just pretended like you didn't care

I make you cry when I run away

Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily
You found a new girl and it only took a couple weeks
Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world?

And good for you, I guess that you've been workin' on yourself
I guess that therapist I found for you, she really helped
Now you can be a better man for your brand-new girl (Girl)

Well, good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you
You're doin' great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

[Verse 2]
Well, good for you, I guess you're gettin' everything you want (Ah)
You bought a new car and your career's really takin' off (Ah)
It's like we never even happened
Baby, what the fuck is up with that? (Ah)
And good for you, it's like you never even met me

'Cause I'm beggin'

[Chorus]
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, darlin'

[Verse 1]
Riding high when I was king
I played it hard and fast, 'cause I had everything
I walked away, you won me then
But easy come and easy go and it would end

[Verse 2]
So anytime I bleed, you let me go
Yah, anytime I feed, you get me, no
Anytime I seek, you let me know
But I plant and seed, just let me go
I'm on my knees when I'm beggin'
'Cause I don't wanna lose you
Hey, yeah, ra-ta-ta-ta!

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm beggin', beggin' you

I need you to understand
Tried so hard to be your man
The kind of man you want in the end
Only then can I begin to live again

[Verse 4]
An empty shell, I used to be
The shadow of my life was hangin' over me
A broken man that I don't know
Won't even stand the devil's dance to win my soul

[Verse 5]
What we doin'? What we chasin'?
Why the bottom? Why the basement?
Why we got good shit, don't embrace it?
Why the feel for the need to replace me?
You're the wrong way track from the good
I want to paint a picture tellin' where we could be at
Like a heart in the best way should
You can give it away, you had it and you took the pay
But I keep walkin' on, keep openin' doors
Keep hopin' for, now the door is yours
Keep also home
'Cause I don't wanna live in a broken home, girl, I'm beggin'
[Chorus]
Mmm, yeah, yeah, I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, darlin'

[Bridge]
I'm fighting hard to hold my own
Just can't make it all alone
I'm holdin' on, I can't fall back
I'm just a calm, 'bout to fade to black

I'm beggin', beggin' you
Put your loving hand out, baby
I'm beggin', beggin' you
So put your loving hand out, darlin'

Good day in my mind, safe to take a step out
Get some air now, let yo edge out
Too soon, I spoke
You be heavy in my mind, can you get the heck out?
I need rest now, got me bummed out
You so, you so, you
Baby, baby, babe
I've been on my empty mind shit

[Pre-Chorus: SZA]
I try to keep from losin' the rest of me
I worry that I wasted the best of me on you, babe
You don't care
Said, ""Not tryna be a nuisance, this is urgent""
Tryna make sense of loose change
Got me a war in my mind
Gotta let go of weight, can't keep what's holdin' me
Choose to watch while the world break up in front of me

[Chorus: SZA, Jacob Collier & Both]
All the while, I'll await my armored fate with a smile
Still wanna try, still believe in

When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true

[Verse 1]
Give me a day or two to think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do, mm-mm
Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passin' through
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to (When I asked you to)
Be cool about what I was tellin' you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do (What you said you'd do)
And I'd end up more afraid
Don't say it isn't fair
You clearly werеn't aware that you made me misеrable
So if you really wanna know

I'm happier than ever (Happier than ever)
Wish I could explain it better (Wish I could explain it better)

'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty
You made me hate this city

Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
And all that you did was make me fuckin' sad
So don't waste the time I don't have
And don't try to make me feel bad

But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends, so I
Shut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid

Nights alone that we miss more
And days we save as souvenirs

Crying 'cause you weren't around

'Cause how could I ever love someone else?

And I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but

Quién lo diría que se podría
Hacer el amor por telepatía
La luna está llena, mi cama vacía
Lo que yo te haría
Si te tuviera de frente, la mente te la volaría
De noche y de día, de noche y de día

[Verso 1]
You know I'm just a flight away
If you want it, you could take a private plane
A kilómetros estamos conectando
Y me prendes aunque no me estés tocando
You know I got a lot to say
All these voices in the background of my brain
Y me dicen todo lo que estás pensando
Me imagino lo que ya estás maquinando

Feelin' young, but they treat me like the OG
And they want the tea on me, I swear these bitches nosey
Said he put some money on my head, I guess we gon' see
I won't put no money on his head, my niggas owe me
I gotta be single for a while, you can't control me
Uno, dos, tres, in a race, they can't hold me
And I show my face in a case so you know it's me
Imitation isn't flattery, it's just annoyin' me
And I'm too about it
And the dirt that they threw on my name
Turned to soil and I grew up out it
Time for y'all to figure out what y'all gon' do about it
Big wheels keep rollin', rollin'

She droppin' her top, she back again
Publicly she at the crib again, company (Yeah, yeah)

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

[Verse 2]
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
'Causе there we arе again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, ""Fuck the patriarchy""
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town
And I was thinkin' on the drive down, ""Any time now
He's gonna say it's love,"" you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame

Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, yeah

Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Runnin' scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest
I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
[Verse 4]
They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weepin' in a party bathroom
Some actress askin' me what happened, you
That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come
And he said, ""It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one""

[Verse 5]
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
[Verse 6]
And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes
""I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age""
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well

[Outro]
Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?
Just between us, I remember it (Just between us) all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (Oh)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it (All too well)
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it224Embed","['Liz Rose', 'Taylor Swift']","['Taylor Swift', 'Jack Antonoff']",7076626,0.631,0.518,0,-8.771,1,0.0303,0.274,0.0,0.088,0.205,93.023,audio_features,5enxwA8aAbwZbf5qCHORXi,spotify:track:5enxwA8aAbwZbf5qCHORXi,https://api.spotify.com/v1/tracks/5enxwA8aAbwZbf5qCHORXi,https://api.spotify.com/v1/audio-analysis/5enxwA8aAbwZbf5qCHORXi,613027,4," lyrics i walked through the door with you, the air was cold but somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow and i left my scarf there at your sister's house and you've still got it in your drawer, even now   oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze we're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place and i can picture it after all these days   and i know it's long gone and that magic's not here no more and i might be okay, but i'm not fine at all oh, oh, oh   'causе there we arе again on that little town street you almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me wind in my hair, i was there i remember it all too well   photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red you used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed and your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team you taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me and you were tossing me the car keys, ""fuck the patriarchy"" keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town and i was thinkin' on the drive down, ""any time now he's gonna say it's love,"" you never called it what it was 'til we were dead and gone and buried check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same after three months in the grave and then you wondered where it went to as i reached for you but all i felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame see taylor swift liveget tickets as low as $6you might also like and i know it's long gone and there was nothing else i could do and i forget about you long enough to forget why i needed to   'cause there we are again in the middle of the night we're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light down the stairs, i was there i remember it all too well and there we are again when nobody had to know you kept me like a secret, but i kept you like an oath sacred prayer and we'd swear to remember it all too well, yeah   well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe i asked for too much but maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up runnin' scared, i was there i remember it all too well and you call me up again just to break me like a promise so casually cruel in the name of bein' honest i'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here 'cause i remember it all, all, all  they say all's well that ends well, but i'm in a new hell every time you double-cross my mind you said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine and that made me want to die the idea you had of me, who was she? a never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you not weepin' in a party bathroom some actress askin' me what happened, you that's what happened, you you who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show but then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come and he said, ""it's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one""   time won't fly, it's like i'm paralyzed by it i'd like to be my old self again, but i'm still tryin' to find it after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own now you mail back my things and i walk home alone but you keep my old scarf from that very first week 'cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me you can't get rid of it 'cause you remember it all too well, yeah   'cause there we are again when i loved you so back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known it was rare, i was there i remember it all too well wind in my hair, you were there you remember it all down the stairs, you were there you remember it all it was rare, i was there i remember it all too well  and i was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes ""i'll get older, but your lovers stay my age"" from when your brooklyn broke my skin and bones i'm a soldier who's returning half her weight and did the twin flame bruise paint you blue? just between us, did the love affair maim you too?

Una noche más y copas de más
Tú no me dejas en paz, de mi mente no te vas

[Coro]
Aunque sé que no debo, ey
Pensar en ti, bebé, pero cuando bebo
Me viene tu nombre, tu cara, tu risa y tu pelo, ey
Dime dónde tú está', que yo por ti cojo un vuelo
Y a Yonaguni le llego, oh
Aunque sé que no debo, ey
Pensar en ti, bebé, pero cuando bebo
Me viene tu nombre, tu cara, tu risa y tu pelo, ey
Dime dónde tú está', que yo por ti cojo un vuelo
Y a Yonaguni le llego, ey

[Verso 1]
No me busque' en Instagram, mami, búscame en casa
Pa' que vea' lo que pasa, ey
Si tú me prueba', te casa', ey
Ese cabrón ni te abraza
Y yo loco por tocarte
Pero ni me atrevo a textearte
Tú con cualquier outfit la parte'
Mami, tú ere' aparte
Shorty, tiene' un culo bien grande, eh
De-Demasia'o grande
Y yo lo tengo estudia'o, ya mismo me gradúo

The second that we called it quits?
And ain't it funny how you said you were friends?
Now it sure as hell don't look like it

[Chorus]
You betrayed me
And I know that you'll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt, yeah
You talked to her when we were together
Loved you at your worst, but that didn't matter
It took you two weeks to go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat, but you're still a traitor

[Verse 2]
Now you bring her around just to shut me down
Show her off like she's a new trophy
And I know if you were true, there's no damn way that you
Could fall in love with somebody that quickly

A broken heart is all that's left
I'm still fixing all the cracks
Lost a couple of pieces when
I carried it, carried it, carried it home
I'm afraid of all I am
My mind feels like a foreign land
Silence ringing inside my head
Please, carry me, carry me, carry me home

I've spent all of the love I saved
We were always a losing game
Small-town boy in a big arcade
I got addicted to a losing game

This ain't Build a Bitch (A bitch)
You don't get to pick and choose
Different ass and bigger boobs
If my eyes are brown or blue
This ain't Build a Bitch (A bitch)
I'm filled with flaws and attitude
So if you need perfect, I'm not built for you (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
Bob the Builder broke my heart
Told me I need fixing
Said that I'm just nuts and bolts
Lotta parts were missing
Curvy like a cursive font
Virgin and a vixen
That's the kind of girl he wants
But he forgot

[Chorus]
This ain't Build a Bitch (A bitch)
You don't get to pick and choose
Different ass and bigger boobs

Beautiful Mistakes (feat. Megan Thee Stallion),Maroon 5,"73 ContributorsTranslationsTürkçePortuguêsDeutschBeautiful Mistakes Lyrics[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
It's beautiful, it's bittersweet
You're like a broken home to me
I take a shot of memories
And black out like an empty street
I fill my days with the way you walk
And fill my nights with broken dreams
I make up lies inside my head
Like one day, you'll come back to me

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Now I'm not holdin' on, not holdin' on
I'm just depressed that you're gone
Not holdin' on, not holdin' on

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Beautiful mistakes
I make inside my head
She's naked in my bed
And now we lie awake
Makin' beautiful mistakes
I wouldn't take 'еm back
I'm in love with the past
And now we liе awake
Makin' beautiful mistakes

It's pitiful, I can't believe
How every day gets worse for me
I take a break, I cut you off
To keep myself from lookin' soft
I fill my nights with the way you was
And still wake up with broken dreams
I make these lies inside my head
Feel like they're my reality

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Now I'm not holdin' on, not holdin' on
I'm just depressed that you're gone
Not holdin' on, not holdin' on

[Verse 3: Megan Thee Stallion]
You did me wrong 'cause I let you (Let you)
Usually, I like my situations beneficial
Doin' something different, got me lookin' stupid (Damn)
The only way I'm comin' back to you is if you dreaming, lucid (Hmm)
Prove it, if you made a promise then keep it (Keep it)
Why you wanna lie and then get mad? I don't believe it (Boy, bye)
But really, I was doin' just fine without ya
Lookin' fine, sippin' wine, dancin' on club couches (Ah)
Baby, why you wanna lose me like you don't need me? (Don't need me)
Like I don't block you and you still try to reach me (Still try to reach me)
How you figure out how to call me from the TV? (Huh?)
You runnin' outta chances and this time I mean it (Ah)

[Bridge: Megan Thee Stallion]
Yeah, bet you miss my love, all in your bed (Bed)
Now you're stressin' out, pulling your hair (Hair)
Smelling your pillows and wishin' I was there (I was there)
Slidin' down the shower wall, lookin' sad (Sad)
I know it's hard to let go, I'm the best (I'm the best)
Best you ever had and best you gon' get (Gon' get)
And if we break up, I don't wanna be friends (Be friends)
You're toxic

Shivers,Ed Sheeran,"84 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolPortuguêsDeutschفارسیதமிழ்日本語ItalianoRomânăSlovenčinaShivers Lyrics[Verse 1]
I took an arrow to the heart
I never kissed a mouth that tastes like yours
Strawberries and then somethin' more
Ooh, yeah, I want it all
Lipstick on my guitar
Fill up the engine, we can drive real far
Go dancin' underneath the stars
Ooh, yeah, I want it all
Mmm, you got me feelin' like

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna be that guy, I wanna kiss your eyes
I wanna drink that smile, I wanna feel like I'm
Like my soul's on fire, I wanna stay up all day and all night
Yeah, you got me singin' like

[Chorus]
Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up, give mе the shivers

But when the heat comes, something takes a hold
Can I kick it? Yeah, I can

We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know

[Pre-Chorus]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""

[Verse 2]
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh

But I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town

And I said, ""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""

I can't fuck with nobody
I can't keep livin' like this, I can't
I tell her what it is and I tell her what it ain't
She know that I been all in her walls like I paint
Told her at times I wanna give you trust, but I can't
Bitch, I really got it out the mud, climbin' up the ranks
When they see me outside, I'm a high roller
I've been on a global jet, but nigga, I fly solo
And I got the Gucci splattered all on her knick-knacks
Fifty racks, I'm 'bout to break her off like a KitKat
And her purse got F's like the wheels on the 'Bach
I just fucked off a million, but I still got a sack
Shorty know that I'm the realest, she know I be speakin' facts
She know that I'm the same nigga that was pushin' 'Cat
She know I got the game, but I'm never gon' give it back

So high up through the clouds, I was swimmin'
I'm probably gon' drown when I'm in it
I bet she gon' get loud when I'm in it
And we might have a child when I'm finished

[Verse 1]
Uh, I won't love a ho, after we fuck, she can't get near me
Only bitch I give a conversation to is Siri
My pants Amiri, yes, I'm winnin', clearly
I'm the chosen one, seen my potential, so they fear me
Lately I've been prayin', God, I wonder, can You hear me?
Thinkin' 'bout the old me, I swear I miss you dearly
Stay down 'til you come up, I've been stickin' to that theory
Every day a battle, I'm exhausted and I'm weary
Make sure I smile in public, when alone, my eyes teary
I fought through it all, but that shit hurt me severely
I've been gettin' high to hide behind my insecurities
Takin' different pills, but I know it ain't gon'—

Homicides when we lurk, I'ma step 'til my feet hurt
Been puttin' them streets first
White tees turned burgundy t-shirts
Lookin' for somethin' real, he stuck in a deep search
Anxiety killin' me, I just want to leave Earth
When they ask if I'm okay, it just make everything seem worse
Try and explain your feelings, sound like something you rehearsed
Stabbed me in my back with a clean smirk
Lookin' so deep into your eyes, I can read your thoughts, so
Shut the fuck—, I mean, please don't talk
I done been through too much and I don't need another loss
Put that on every war scar for every battle I fought

[Intro: ROSALÍA]
Yo sé que esto no volverá a pasar
Pero si volviera a pasar, sé que sería tu debilidad

[Coro: ROSALÍA & Bad Bunny, Ambos]
Porque la noche de anoche fue
Algo que yo no puedo explicar
Eso era dando y dándole sin parar
Tú me decías que morías por mí
Porque la noche de anoche fue (Eh-eh)
Algo que yo no puedo explicar (Eh-eh)
Eso era dando y dándole sin parar (Eh-eh)
Tú encima de mí, yo encima de ti (Oh-oh)
Eh, eh

[Verso 1: Bad Bunny & ROSALÍA]
Tú me dejaste el cuerpo caliente, infierno
Pero me dejaste el corazón frío, invierno
Soñando que contigo e' que duermo (Duermo)
Dime, papi
Dime, mami
¿Esa noche quién la borra?
Tú me besaste y se me cayó la gorra
Sin mucha labia, sin mucha cotorra
Cuando 'toy contigo dejo que la vibra corra
Y que la luna no' supervise
Con esa boquita suena rico to' lo que tú me dice'
Hicimo' pose' que yo má' nunca hice
Tú te mojaste' pa' que yo me bautice
Y me ponga serio, serio
Tú y yo junto' creando un imperio
Eso' ojito' tienen un misterio
Pero al final na' 'e lo nuestro fue en serio

[Intro: Myke Towers]
Ella e' buena, pero le gustan lo' malo' (Malo')
Si te soy sincero, yo por ella jalo (Ella jalo)
Me tiró diciéndome que la dejaron (La dejaron)
Es otra más que con su corazón jugaron, ey

[Coro: Juhn]
¿Ese bandido qué le hizo? Dígame por qué llora (Llora)
Confiéseme pa' darle piso y enterrarlo ahora (Ahora)
Que yo la puedo defender a usted si me colabora (-bora)
Le voy a dejar saber a ese man que ya no está sola (¡Wuh!)
¿Ese bandido qué le hizo? Dígame por qué llora (Dígame por qué llora)
Confiéseme pa' darle piso y enterrarlo ahora (Ahora)
Que yo la puedo defender a usted si me colabora (Sirili, woh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Le voy a dejar saber a ese man que ya no está sola (¡Wuh!)

[Verso 1: Myke Towers]
Mi amor, avísame si acaso te incomoda
Pa' reventarlo y que sepa que no estás sola
Yo te hablo claro, yo no brego con pistola'
Pero tengo el respeto de lo' que controlan
Tú ere' hermosa, mami, dime por qué llora'
Te haría mi señora
Ella le da lo mismo en un crucero que una yola
Condone' de colore', la parto a lo Crayola
Mujere' como tú uno las desea y las añora (Añora)
Dile que tú tiene' vaqueo
Si pone' el booty en reversa
Yo le prendo la cámara como cuando parqueo
Le gusta el maleanteo
Dice que la están buscando porque mata la liga, yo se lo creo

[Puente: Juhn & Myke Towers]
Qué pereza
Verla triste con tanta belleza
Quien dañó un corazón con mucha pureza
No sabe tratar con delicadeza (-deza)
Princesa, a él no le interesa
Si yo soy el que te toca y te besa
Cuando la vi yo dije: ""Quiero con esa""
Desde esa vez no sales de mi cabeza

Something's in the air right now
Like I'm losin' track of time (Time, time)
Like I don't really care right now
But maybe that's fine
You weren't even there that day
I was waitin' on you (You, you)
I wonder if you were aware that day
Was the last straw for me and I knew

[Pre-Chorus]
I sent you flowers
Did you even care?
You ran the shower
And left them by the stairs
Ooh-ooh-ooh, a-a-a-ayy
Thought you had your shit together, but damn, I was wrong (Wrong)

[Chorus]
You ain't nothin' but a lost cause (Cause, cause)
And this ain't nothin' like it oncе was (Was, was)
I know you think you're such an outlaw

Praise God,Kanye West,"307 ContributorsTranslationsKanye West - Praise God ft. Baby Keem & Travis Scott (Türkçe Çeviri)SvenskaEspañolPortuguêsEnglishFrançaisPraise God Lyrics[Intro: Travis Scott & Donda West]
That she wrote, ""Speech to the Young: Speech to the Progress-Toward""
Say to them, say to the down-keepers, the sun-slappers
The self-soilers, the harmony-hushers
Even if you are not ready for the day, it cannot always be night
Serve, flex, I do work (Work)
Six, I'm like Mike
He's out of sight, woo
You done got me piped
Two-man like Ike
Six out the spot (Uh, uh)
Into the night

[Verse 1: Travis Scott & Kanye West]
Yeah, I'm shakin' the drop (Drop)
I'm still up on top (Aight)
I been had the bop
The devil my opp, can't pay me to stop (It's lit)
My God at the top (La Flame)

[Chorus: Kanye West & Donda West]
We gon' praise our way out the grave, dawg
Livin', speakin', praise God
Walkin' out the graveyard back to life
I serve, follow your word, see with new sight, into the night (Hey)
You might also like[Verse 2: Travis Scott & Kanye West]
Yeah, this life I'm livin' (I'm livin')
All the advice been tipped in (That thang)
Gave me that grip, no slippin' (That grip)
Out of my mind, went trippin' (My mind)
Tell me take two when I'm on one (I'm on)
That lookout like no one
Kept it real tight like your son (Your son)
Yeah (La Flame)

[Chorus: Kanye West & Donda West]
We gon' praise our way out the grave, dawg
Livin', speakin', praise God
Walkin' out the graveyard back to life
I serve, follow your word, see with new sight, into the night
[Verse 3: Baby Keem]
Still on side, huh, still outside
****, attention, still outside, huh, still outside
Tame Imp—, Tame Impala, ****
Tame Impala, stay outside, huh
And I'm still outside, I'm still outside, still outside, huh
Let's get right, huh, let's get right, uh, let's get right, uh, huh
Let's get right, let's get (Ayy, ayy, ayy), let's get right
Let's get (Ayy, ayy, ayy), let's get—
Look at new scenes, I opened my life, I'm subject to memes
I signed a few ****, I polished their dreams
An angel on earth, come under my wing
Stop runnin' your publishers, ****
They publish the headlines and say the wrong things
Y'all treat your Lord and Savior like renters' insurance, you know what I mean?
Bada the bada the boom, I bada the boom, I bada the bing
I need a new girl, my old one was mean
I had to let go, forgave all them evils that came to my shows
I channeled them bad **** all in abode
I channeled your trust, I channeled the turbulence, came with the life
I gathered my sinners and asked if I'm right, let's get
I just get right, ****, huh
Let's get right, let's get right, let's get right, shh, shh
Ain't on sight, it's on sight
I don't know you, you, you, you, it's on sight
I don't know you, you, you, you (Ayy, ayy), let's get right
Ayy, all of my **** on Channel 5
I don't channel ten 'til it go time
Used to throw up my uncle's spaghetti
Been told to tote since before I was ready
Back when my mama told me that I was challenged
A single Black woman, you know that she petty
I turned a heavy heart to two million dollars
I put that in totals, reverse outta debty
I gotta, I gotta put on a rager one time
I swung the powder, went major one time
I know some white people servin' no time
I gotta do it for me, do it for, pray for me
Do it for all the ones dyin'
I wanna do it for all the ones cryin'
I wanna, uh, uh, uh, let's get right, huh125Embed","['Kanye West', 'Travis Scott', 'Baby Keem', '竜真知子 (Machiko Ryu)', '加藤和彦 (Kazuhiko Kato)', 'SLOAN (Producer)', 'Malik Yusef', 'Rhymefest', 'The Twilite Tone', 'KayCyy', 'Raul Cubina', 'Mark Williams', 'ZenTachi', 'MIKE DEAN', '30 Roc', 'Ojivolta', 'CyHi']","['The Twilite Tone', 'Ojivolta', 'MIKE DEAN', 'Kanye West', 'ZenTachi', '30 Roc', 'Sloane']",5780838,0.798,0.545,1,-6.466,1,0.168,0.00904,9.48e-05,0.258,0.212,118.029,audio_features,0WSEq9Ko4kFPt8yo3ICd6T,spotify:track:0WSEq9Ko4kFPt8yo3ICd6T,https://api.spotify.com/v1/tracks/0WSEq9Ko4kFPt8yo3ICd6T,https://api.spotify.com/v1/audio-analysis/0WSEq9Ko4kFPt8yo3ICd6T,226653,4," that she wrote, ""speech to the young: speech to the progress-toward"" say to them, say to the down-keepers, the sun-slappers the self-soilers, the harmony-hushers even if you are not ready for the day, it cannot always be night serve, flex, i do work (work) six, i'm like mike he's out of sight, woo you done got me piped two-man like ike six out the spot (uh, uh) into the night   yeah, i'm shakin' the drop (drop) i'm still up on top (aight) i been had the bop the devil my opp, can't pay me to stop (it's lit) my god at the top (la flame)   we gon' praise our way out the grave, dawg livin', speakin', praise god walkin' out the graveyard back to life i serve, follow your word, see with new sight, into the night (hey) you might also like yeah, this life i'm livin' (i'm livin') all the advice been tipped in (that thang) gave me that grip, no slippin' (that grip) out of my mind, went trippin' (my mind) tell me take two when i'm on one (i'm on) that lookout like no one kept it real tight like your son (your son) yeah (la flame)   we gon' praise our way out the grave, dawg livin', speakin', praise god walkin' out the graveyard back to life i serve, follow your word, see with new sight, into the night  still on side, huh, still outside ****, attention, still outside, huh, still outside tame imp—, tame impala, **** tame impala, stay outside, huh and i'm still outside, i'm still outside, still outside, huh let's get right, huh, let's get right, uh, let's get right, uh, huh let's get right, let's get (ayy, ayy, ayy), let's get right let's get (ayy, ayy, ayy), let's get— look at new scenes, i opened my life, i'm subject to memes i signed a few ****, i polished their dreams an angel on earth, come under my wing stop runnin' your publishers, **** they publish the headlines and say the wrong things y'all treat your lord and savior like renters' insurance, you know what i mean? bada the bada the boom, i bada the boom, i bada the bing i need a new girl, my old one was mean i had to let go, forgave all them evils that came to my shows i channeled them bad **** all in abode i channeled your trust, i channeled the turbulence, came with the life i gathered my sinners and asked if i'm right, let's get i just get right, ****, huh let's get right, let's get right, let's get right, shh, shh ain't on sight, it's on sight i don't know you, you, you, you, it's on sight i don't know you, you, you, you (ayy, ayy), let's get right ayy, all of my **** on channel  i don't channel ten 'til it go time used to throw up my uncle's spaghetti been told to tote since before i was ready back when my mama told me that i was challenged a single black woman, you know that she petty i turned a heavy heart to two million dollars i put that in totals, reverse outta debty i gotta, i gotta put on a rager one time i swung the powder, went major one time i know some white people servin' no time i gotta do it for me, do it for, pray for me do it for all the ones dyin' i wanna do it for all the ones cryin' i wanna, uh, uh, uh, let's get right, huh12",72.0
