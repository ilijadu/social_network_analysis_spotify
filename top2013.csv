I Wanna Be Yours,Arctic Monkeys,"119 ContributorsTranslationsTürkçeEnglishFrançaisDeutschالعربيةPortuguêsI Wanna Be Yours Lyrics[Verse 1]
I wanna be your vacuum cleaner
Breathin' in your dust
I wanna be your Ford Cortina
I will never rust
If you like your coffee hot
Let me be your coffee pot
You call the shots, babe
I just wanna be yours

[Pre-Chorus]
Secrets I have held in my heart
Are harder to hide than I thought
Maybe I just wanna be yours

[Chorus]
I wanna be yours
I wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours
Wanna be yours

[Verse 2]
Let me be your 'leccy meter
An' I'll never run out
Let me be the portable heater
That you'll get cold without
I wanna be your setting lotion (Wanna be)
Hold your hair in deep devotion (How deep?)
At least as deep as the Pacific Ocean
I wanna be yours

'Cause your shine is somethin' like a mirror
And I can't help but notice
You reflect in this heart of mine
If you ever feel alone and
The glare makes me hard to find
Just know that I'm always parallel on the other side

'Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the glass
I'm here tryin' to pull you through
You just gotta be strong

'Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Comin' back here to you once I figured it out
You were right here all along

It's like you're my mirror
My mirror staring back at me
I couldn't get any bigger
With anyone else beside of me
And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making two reflections into one
'Cause it's like you're my mirror
My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me

Aren't you somethin', an original
'Cause it doesn't seem merely a sample
And I can't help but stare, 'cause
I see truth somewhere in your eyes
I can't ever change without you
You reflect me, I love that about you
And if I could, I would look at us all the time

'Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the glass
I'm here tryin' to pull you through
You just gotta be strong

'Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now

And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making two reflections into one
'Cause it's like you're my mirror
My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me

Yesterday is history
Tomorrow's a mystery
I can see you lookin' back at me
Keep your eyes on me
Baby, keep your eyes on me

'Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now (please show me, baby)
I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Comin' back here to you once I figured it out
You were right here all along

It's like you're my mirror

I couldn't get any bigger

And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making two reflections into one
'Cause it's like you're my mirror
My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me

You are, you are the love of my life [10x]

Now you're the inspiration of this precious song
And I just wanna see your face light up since you put me on
So now I say goodbye to the old me, it's already gone
And I can't wait wait wait wait wait to get you home
Just to let you know, you are

You are, you are the love of my life [8x]

Girl you're my reflection, all I see is you
My reflection, in everything I do
You're my reflection and all I see is you
My reflection, in everything I do

You are, you are the love of my life",79

The mirror's image tells me it's home time
But I'm not finished, 'cause you're not by my side
And as I arrived I thought I saw you leavin'
Carryin' your shoes
Decided that once again I was just dreamin'
Of bumpin' into you

And I'm tryna' change your mind
Left you multiple missed calls
And to my message, you reply

[Verse 2]
Somewhere darker, talkin' the same shite
I need a partner, (High) well are you out tonight?
It's harder and harder to get you to listen
More I get through the gears
Incapable of makin' alright decisions
And having bad ideas

Now, it's three in the mornin'

Left you multiple missed calls
And to my message, you reply (Message, you reply)

When the days are cold and the cards all fold
And the saints we see are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail and the ones we hail
Are the worst of all, and the blood's run stale

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna hide the truth, I wanna shelter you
But with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

[Chorus]
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide

At the curtain's call it's the last of all
When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave and the masquerade
Will come calling out at the mess you've made

Guided by a beating heart
I can't tell where the journey will end
But I know where to start

They tell me I'm too young to understand
They say I'm caught up in a dream
Well life will pass me by if I don't open up my eyes
Well that's fine by me

[2x]
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost

I tried carrying the weight of the world
But I only have two hands
Hope I get the chance to travel the world
But I don't have any plans

Wish that I could stay forever this young
Not afraid to close my eyes
Life's a game made for everyone
And love is the prize

So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older

Alone without you by my side

Have you got colour in your cheeks?
Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift the type
That sticks around like summat in your teeth?
Are there some aces up your sleeve?
Have you no idea that you're in deep?
I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week
How many secrets can you keep?

That makes me think of you somehow an' I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep, spillin' drinks on my settee

Can't count the years on one hand that we've been together
I need the other one to hold you
Make you feel, make you feel better
It's not a walk in the park to love each other
But when our fingers interlock
Can't deny, can't deny you're worth it

'Cause after all this time
I'm still into you

I should be over all the butterflies
But I'm into you (I'm into you)

Recount the night that I first met your mother
And on the drive back to my house
I told you that, I told you that I loved ya

We sang along to the start of forever

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
Return of the Mack
Get 'em; what it is? What it does? What it is? What it isn't?
Looking for a better way to get up outta bed
Instead of getting on the Internet
And checking on who hit me, get up
Thrift shop, pimp-strut walkin'
Little bit of humble, little bit of cautious
Somewhere between like Rocky and Cosby
Sweater game, nope, nope, y'all can't copy, yeah
Bad, moonwalking, this here is our party
My posse's been on Broadway, and we did it our way
Grown music, I shed my skin and put my bones
Into everything I record to it and yet I'm on
Let that stage light go and shine on down
Got that Bob Barker suit game and Plinko in my style
Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town
Trust me on my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T shit, hustlin'
Chasing dreams since I was fourteen
With the four-track, bussin'
Halfway 'cross that city with the back (Back) pack (Pack), fat (Fat) cat (Cat), crushin'

We give that to the people, spread it across the country (Hey, hey, hey, oh)

Now, can I kick it? Thank you
Yeah, I'm so damn grateful
I grew up really wanting gold fronts
But that's what you get when Wu-Tang raised you
Y'all can't stop me
Go hard like I got a 808 in my heartbeat
And I'm eating at the beat like you gave a little speed
To a great white shark on Shark Week, raw
Time to go off, I'm gone
Deuces, goodbye, I got a world to see
And my girl, she wanna see Rome
Caesar'll make you a believer
Nah, I never ever did it for a throne
That validation comes from giving it back to the people
Now, sing a song, and it goes like
Raise those hands, this is our party (Hey, hey, hey)
We came here to live life like nobody was watching (Hey, hey, hey, oh)

A hundred jewels on throats
A hundred jewels between teeth
Now bring my boys in
Their skin in craters like the moon
The moon we love like a brother

[Chorus]
Well, you only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
Only know you love her when you let her go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
Only hate the road when you're missing home
Only know you love her when you let her go

And you let her go

[Verse 1]
Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
But dreams come slow and they go so fast
You see her when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely dies

But you only need the light when it's burning low

B-B-Be careful making wishes in the dark, dark
Can't be sure when they've hit their mark
And besides in the mean-meantime, I'm just
Dreaming of tearing you apart
I'm in the deep details with the devil
You know, the world can never get me on my level
I just gotta get you out the cage, I'm a young lover's rage
Gonna need a spark to ignite

Burn everything you love then burn the ashes
In the end everything collides, my childhood
Spat back out the monster that you see

Many days fell away with nothing to show

And the walls kept tumbling down in the city that we love
Grey clouds roll over the hills, bringing darkness from above

But if you close your eyes, does it almost feel like nothing changed at all?
And if you close your eyes, does it almost feel like you've been here before?

High dive into frozen waves
Where the past comes back to life
Fight fear for the selfish pain
It was worth it every time
Hold still right before we crash
'Cause we both know how this ends
Our clock ticks till it breaks your glass
And I drown in you again

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you are the piece of me
I wish I didn't need
Chasing relentlessly
Still fight and I don't know why

If our love is tragedy
Why are you my remedy?
If our love's insanity

If you pull, then I'll push too deep
And I'll fall right back to you

You took my heart and you held it in your mouth
And with a word, all my love came rushin' out
And every whisper, it's the worst
Emptied out by a single word
There is a hollow in me now

So I'll put my faith in somethin' unknown
I'm livin' on such sweet nothin'
But I'm tired of hope with nothin' to hold
I'm livin' on such sweet nothin'

And all I am is a man
I want the world in my hands
I hate the beach, but I stand
In California with my toes in the sand
Use the sleeves of my sweater, let's have an adventure
Head in the clouds, but my gravity's centered
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
You in those little high-waisted shorts, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
She knows what I think about
And what I think about
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no

'Cause it's too cold for you here and now
So let me hold both your hands in the holes of my sweater

And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides a mind

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Money's the motivation, money's the conversation
You on vacation, we gettin' paid, so
We on paycation, I did it for the fam
It's whatever we had to do, it's just who I am
Yeah, it's the life I chose
Gunshots in the dark, one eye closed
And we got it cookin' like a one-eyed stove
You can catch me kissin' my girl with both eyes closed, yeah
Perfectin' my passion, thanks for askin'
Couldn't slow down, so we had to crash it
You used plastic, we 'bout cash
I see some people ahead that we gon' pass, yeah!

[Pre-Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
I never feared death or dyin' (Woo)
I only fear never tryin' (Woo)
I am whatever I am
Only God can judge me now

Ridin' with the plug, so I'm close to the outlet
At the red light, rims sittin' offset
I look better on your girl than her outfit (Uh)

Stuck to the plan, always said that we would stand up, never ran
We the fam and loyalty never change up
Been down since day one, look at where we came from
Jumpin' out on anybody who try to say some
One thing about it: got a problem? I got the same one
Money rolls, we fold
Plenty clubs we closed
Follow the same code
Never turn our backs, our cars don't even lose control

I don't know why
You think that you could hold me
When you couldn't get by by yourself
And I don't know who
Would ever want to tear the seam of someone's dream
Baby, it's fine, you said that we should just be friends
Well I came up with that line and I'm sure
That it's for the best
If you ever change your mind, don't hold your breath

'Cause you may not believe
That baby, I'm relieved
When you said goodbye, my whole world shined

Eyes shut, still got me swimming like a diver
Can't let go, I got fans in Okinawa
My heart to Japan, quake losers and survivors
Norway, no, you didn't get my flowers
No way to say it better, but the killer was a coward
Face just showered, the minute in a hour
Heard about the news, whole day went sour
Bitter moments got me feeling like a Lemonhead
Put you in the box just as poisonous as cigarettes
There go my regards, but regardless I get arrested
Ain't worried about the killers, just the young and restless
Getting mad 'cause there's a quarter million on my necklace

Same Love (feat. Mary Lambert),Macklemore & Ryan Lewis,"292 ContributorsTranslationsFrançaisSame Love Lyrics[Piano Intro]
[Verse 1: Macklemore]
When I was in the third grade, I thought that I was gay
'Cause I could draw, my uncle was, and I kept my room straight
I told my mom, tears rushing down my face
She's like, ""Ben, you've loved girls since before Pre-K""
Trippin', yeah, I guess she had a point, didn't she?
A bunch of stereotypes all in my head
I remember doing the math like, ""Yeah, I'm good at little league""
A pre-conceived idea of what it all meant
For those that like the same sex had the characteristics
The right-wing conservatives think it's a decision
And you can be cured with some treatment and religion
Man-made, rewiring of a pre-disposition
Playing God, aw nah, here we go
America the brave still fears what we don't know
And ""God loves all his children"" is somehow forgotten
But we paraphrase a book written thirty-five hundred years ago
I don't know
[Chorus: Mary Lambert]
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

If I was gay, I would think hip-hop hates me
Have you read the YouTube comments lately?
""Man, that's gay"" gets dropped on the daily
We've become so numb to what we're sayin'
Our culture founded from oppression
Yet we don't have acceptance for 'em
Call each other faggots behind the keys of a message board
A word rooted in hate, yet our genre still ignores it
And ""gay"" is synonymous with the lesser
It's the same hate that's caused wars from religion
Gender to skin color, the complexion of your pigment
The same fight that led people to walk-outs and sit-ins
It's human rights for everybody, there is no difference
Live on and be yourself
When I was at church they taught me something else
If you preach hate at the service, those words aren't anointed
That holy water that you soak in has been poisoned
When everyone else is more comfortable remaining voiceless
Rather than fighting for humans that have had their rights stolen
I might not be the same, but that's not important
No freedom 'til we're equal, damn right I support it
[Trombone Interlude]
[Chorus: Mary Lambert]
And I can't change
Even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
[Verse 3: Macklemore]
We press play, don't press pause, progress, march on
With a veil over our eyes, we turn our back on the cause
'Til the day that my uncles can be united by law
When kids are walking 'round the hallway
Plagued by a pain in their heart
A world so hateful, some would rather die than be who they are
And a certificate on paper isn't gonna solve it all
But it's a damn good place to start
No law's gonna change us, we have to change us
Whatever god you believe in, we come from the same one
Strip away the fear, underneath it's all the same love
About time that we raised up, sing
[Chorus: Mary Lambert]

I walked across an empty land
I knew the pathway like the back of my hand
I felt the earth beneath my feet
Sat by the river and it made me complete

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh simple thing, where have you gone?
I'm getting tired and I need someone to rely on

[Verse 2]
I came across a fallen tree
I felt the branches of it looking at me
Is this the place we used to love?
Is this the place that I've been dreaming of?

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh simple thing, where have you gone?
I'm getting old and I need something to rely on

And if you have a minute why don't we go
Talk about it somewhere only we know?

Puttin' my defenses up
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If I ever did that, I think I'd have a heart attack

[Verse 1]
Never put my love out on the line
Never said ""yes"" to the right guy
Never had trouble getting what I want
But when it comes to you, I'm never good enough
When I don't care
I can play 'em like a Ken doll
Won't wash my hair
Then make 'em bounce like a basketball

[Pre-Chorus]
But you make me wanna act like a girl
Paint my nails and wear high heels, yes, you
Make me so nervous that I just can't hold your hand

You make me glow
But I cover up, won't let it show
So I'm puttin' my defenses up (Up)

It feels so good, but you know it hurts

Heart beats fast, colors and promises
How to be brave? How can I love when I'm afraid to fall?
But watching you stand alone
All of my doubt suddenly goes away somehow

[Pre-Chorus]
One step closer

[Chorus]
I have died every day waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more

[Verse 2]
Time stands still, beauty in all she is
I will be brave, I will not let anything take away
What's standing in front of me
Every breath, every hour has come to this

[Pre-Chorus]
One step closer

I have died every day waiting for you
Darling, don't be afraid
I have loved you for a thousand years
I'll love you for a thousand more
And all along, I believed I would find you

[Verse 1: Blake Shelton]
I was gonna keep it real like chill like only have a drink or two
But it turned into a party when I started talking to you
Now you're standing in the neon looking like a high I wanna be on
Baby it's your call, no pressure at all

[Chorus: Blake Shelton]
You don’t have to throw back your pretty pink lemonade shooter and lean a little closer
You don’t have to keep on smiling that smile that’s driving me wild and when the night is almost over
Meet me in the middle of a moonlit Chevy bench seat and do a little bit of country song, hanging on
You don’t have to keep me fallin’ like this
But it’d sure be cool if you did

[Verse 2: Blake Shelton]
You can’t shoot me down cause you already knocked me dead
Got me falling apart with my heart talking out of my head
Let your mind take a little back road
Just as far as you wanna go
Baby I’ll do whatever you wanna do

[Chorus: Blake Shelton]
You don't have to throw back your pretty pink lemonade shooter
And lean a little closer
You don't have to keep on smiling that smile that's driving me wild
And when the night is almost over
Meet me in the middle of a moonlit Chevy bench seat
And do a little bit of country song, hanging on
You don't have to keep me falling like this

In the beginnin'
I never thought it would be you
When we were chillin'
Smilin' in the photobooth
But we got closer (Yeah)
Soon you were eating off my spoon
You're comin' over
And we would talk all afternoon

[Pre-Chorus]
Tonight we'll just get drunk, disturb the peace
Find your hands all over me
And then you bite your lip, whisper and say
""We're goin' all the way""

[Chorus]
Tonight, take me to the other side
Sparks fly like the Fourth of July
Just take me to the other side
I see that sexy look in your eyes
And I know, we ain't friends anymore
If we walk down this road, we'll be lovers for sho'
So tonight, kiss me like it's do or die
And take me to the other side

Yeah, when I first saw that bikini top on her
She’s poppin' right out of the South Georgia water
Thought, ""Oh, good lord,"" she had them long tanned legs
Couldn't help myself, so I walked up and said

[Chorus]
Well, baby, you a song, you make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road, blowin' stop signs through the middle every little farm town with you
And this brand new Chevy with a lift kit would look a hell of a lot better with you up in it, heh
So, baby, you a song, you make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise

[Verse 2]
Well, she was sippin' on Southern and singin' Marshall Tucker
We were fallin' in love in the sweet heart of summer
She hopped right up into the cab of my truck and said
""Fire it up, let's go get this thing stuck""

Baby, you a song, you make me wanna roll my windows down and cruise
Down a back road, blowin' stop signs through the middle every little farm town with you
