(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

[Pre-Chorus]
Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

[Chorus]
And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you

[Verse 2]
Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
I'm not dying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people

Rain
He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight

[Verse 1]
My town was a wasteland
Full of cages, full of fences
Pageant queens and big pretenders
But for some, it was paradise
My boy was a montage
A slow-motion, love potion
Jumping off things in the ocean
I broke his heart 'cause he was nice
He was sunshine, I was midnight rain

[Chorus]
He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight

[Verse 2]
It came like a postcard
Picture perfect shiny family
Holiday peppermint candy
But for him, it's every day
So I peered through a window
A deep portal, time travel
All the love we unravel
And the life I gave away
'Cause he was sunshine, I was midnight rain

I saw flecks of what could've been lights

Life is emotionally abusive
And time can't stop me quite like you did
And my flight was awful, thanks for asking
I'm unglued, thanks to you

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, ""Fuck the patriarchy""
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town
And I was thinkin' on the drive down, ""Any time now
He's gonna say it's love,"" you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame

They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weepin' in a party bathroom
Some actress askin' me what happened, you
That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come
And he said, ""It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one""

Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes
""I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age""
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well

We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know

[Pre-Chorus]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""

[Verse 2]
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh

This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""

[Post-Chorus]

[Bridge]
But I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town

[Chorus]
And I said, ""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone

Lame fights over the phone
Wake up in the mornin' with someone

In someone's handwriting, not mine
Sneakin' out into town
Holdin' hands, just killin' time

Stars all aligned and they intertwined
And taught you
The way you call me ""baby""
Treat me like a lady
All that I can say is

All of the girls you loved before (Ooh)
Made you the one I've fallen for

I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
Chasin' shadows in the grocery line
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light
And I knew you'd come back to me
You'd come back to me

Tell you that I'm sorry, tell me what I gotta do

This will leave an ugly scar

I wake up to the sounds
Of the silence that allows
For my mind to run around
With my ear up to the ground

I'm searching to behold
The stories that are told
When my back is to the world
That was smiling when I turned

Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn they hate us

Oh the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be
My enemy-y-y-y-y

My enemy(Look)-y(Look)-y(Look)-y(Look)-y
(Look out for yourself)
But I'm ready

Your words up on the wall
As you're praying for my fall
And the laughter in the halls
And the names that I've been called

I stack it in my mind
And I'm waiting for the time
When I show you what it's like
To be words spit in a mic

Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn they hate us
(Huh)

Oh the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy

Everybody wants to be

[JID:]
Uh, look, okay
I'm hoping that somebody pray for me
I'm praying that somebody hope for me
I'm staying where nobody 'posed to be
P-P-Posted
Being a wreck of emotions
Ready to go whenever, just let me know
The road is long, so put the pedal into the floor
The enemy's on my trail, my energy unavailable
I'ma tell 'em hasta luego
They wanna plot on my trot to the top
I've been outta shape
Thinkin' out the box
I'm an astronaut
I blasted off the planet rock
To cause catastrophe
And it matters more because I had it not
Had I thought about wreaking havoc on an opposition
Kinda shocking they wanted static
With precision, I'm automatic, quarterback, I ain't talkin' sacking
Pack it, pack it up, I don't panic
Batter, batter up
Who the baddest?
It don't matter 'cause we at ya throat

Thought I almost died in my dream again (Baby, almost died)
Fightin' for my life, I couldn't breathe again
I'm fallin' in too deep (Oh, oh)
Without you, I can't sleep (Fallin' in)
'Cause my heart belongs to you
I'll risk it all for you
I want you next to me
This time, I'll never leave
I wanna share babies
Protection, we won't need
Your body next to me
Is just a memory
I'm fallin' in too deep, oh
Without you, I can't sleep
Insomnia relieve, oh
Talk to me, without you, I can't breathe

[Verse 2]
My darkest hours
Girl, I felt so alone inside of this crowded room
Different girls on the floor, distractin' my thoughts of you
I turned into the man I used to be, to be
Put myself to sleep
Just so I can get closer to you inside my dreams
Didn't wanna wake up 'less you were beside me
I just wanted to call you and say, and say

Where are you now when I need you most?
I'd give it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart

[Verse 3]
Never comin' down, uh
I was running away from facin' reality, uh
Wastin' all of my time out living my fantasies
Spendin' money to compensate, compensate
'Cause I want you, baby, uh
I be livin' in heaven when I'm inside of you
It was simply a blessing wakin' beside you
I'll never let you down again, again

[Chorus]
Oh, baby
Where are you now when I need you most?
I'd give it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart
I said, baby
I'll treat you better than I did before
I'll hold you down and not let you go
This time, I won't break your heart, your heart, yeah
[Bridge]
I know it's all my fault
Made you put down your guard
I know I made you fall
Then said you were wrong for me
I lied to you, I lied to you, I lied to you (To you)
Can't hide the truth, I'd stay with her in spite of you
You did some things that you regret, still ride for you
'Cause this house is not a home

[Chorus]
Without my baby
Where are you now when I need you most?
I gave it all just to hold you close

There's so much trauma in my life
I've been so cold to the ones who loved me, baby
I look back now and I realize

You begged me with your drowning eyes to stay
And I regret I didn't tell you
Now I can't keep you from loving him
You made up your mind

Say I love you, girl, but I'm out of time
Say I'm there for you, but I'm out of time
Say that I'll care for you, but I'm out of time
Said I'm too late to make you mine, out of time (Ah)

If he mess up just a little
Baby, you know my line

우리는 너를 따라 이 긴 밤을 수놓을 거야

While my friends are somewhere else

I step in the bar, it hit me so hard, oh, how can it be this heavy?

So much to put an answer to
But that's just what we do

[Интро: Future]
Раньше хотел трахнуть девушку из R&B, потом это случилось, е, е
Раньше хотел быть богатым, потом это наконец-то случилось
Думал, что это сделает меня счастливым (Думал, что это сделает меня счастливым)

[Куплет 1: Future]
Я мог бы взять боль на себя и ушел бы с позором
Улицы подняли меня, но у меня не было отца
Парни пытаются клонировать меня, украсть мой стиль
Продаю кокаин, на моей куртке Chanel (Куртка)
Малышка дает мне помыться с меньшим количеством, это не продлится (Не продлится)
Принимая еще больше наркотиков в одиночестве в особняке
Брожу по дому с пистолетом в руках (Брожу по дому с пистолетом)
Просто еще одна бедная шлюха, проповедующая за деньги (Ещё одна шлюха)
И я знаю, что меня ждет миллиардный аванс (У-ха)

[Припев: Travis Scott & Future]
Я могу видеть будущее, я могу видеть будущее (Я могу видеть будущее)
Я могу видеть будущее, выглядит так, будто мы пролетаем сквозь небо
Я не могу дождаться, чтобы жить в славе вечной жизни (Жить в славе)
Ты возьмешь руль? И я прилегу и сижу неподвижно
Так что лучше сейчас поднимайся, Он появится неожиданно
К трубам, нравится ли тебе звук? (Нравится ли звук?)

Я могу видеть будущее
Еду со Шторми, с Вольфом и несколькими бойцами
Прокатываюсь сквозь эту ерунду, эта ерунда глупая
Хожу по небу, как Люк, а
Уворачиваюсь от всех этих разговоров, словно Брюс, супер
Гуляю с моими ангелами, уклоняясь от Люцифера (Гуляю)
Вижу каждый угол, я могу видеть сквозь тебя, е (Е)

Делю свою сучку со своей шлюхой, мне не холодно (Нет)
Ты либо добиваешься денег, либо сплетничаешь (Е)

[Куплет 2: Future]
Места, о которых я даже не думал, нашел моделей в них
Слышу демонов ясно, когда они зовут (Е)
Самый стильный на земле, поэтому я дал себе имя планеты (Pluto)
Автоматически мертв, когда ты идешь против моей семьи
Несколько разрывов стали публичными, я просто купил новую красавицу (Купил новую красавицу)
Телка знала, что я токсичен, когда познакомилась со мной, я был дикарём (Познакомилась, я был дикарём)
Высоко в горах, пытаясь избежать всех этих суматох (Е)
Личный на Lear, это как будто мы представляли
Продаю только Hi-Tech, потому что у меня нет Активиса (Е)
Я стараюсь быть скромным (Е), звучит, будто я хвастаюсь (Хвастаюсь)
Картье на моих оправах (Оправы), всё из-за моей известности (Известность)
Та сука сказала, что стыдно любить меня публично, предпочтет быть в тайне (Видел уже достаточно)

[Рефрен: Future]
Считаю столько денег, пока моя кожа не отпадет
Вишнево-красный Бенц, как настоящий мачо (Е)

Делю свою сучку со своей шлюхой, мне не холодно (Нет)
Ты либо добиваешься денег, либо сплетничаешь (Е)

[Припев: Travis Scott]
Я могу видеть будущее, выглядит так, будто мы пролетаем сквозь небо
Я не могу дождаться, чтобы жить в славе вечной жизни
Ты возьмешь руль? И я прилегу и сижу неподвижно
Так что лучше сейчас поднимайся, Он появится неожиданно
К трубам, нравится ли тебе звук?
[Бридж: SZA & Travis Scott]
Мне всё не хватает, я же говорила тебе, что просто хочу всего этого
Мне всё не хватает, ты делаешь недостаточно (Тебе нравится, как это звучит?)
Так холодно, так холодно
Здесь так холодно, так холодно, так холодно

[Куплет 3: SZA]
Ты можешь видеть будущее, в твоих глазах сверкает искорка
Почему ты так близко к моему бедру? Не могу тебе позволить
Типы замышляют мою смерть, у меня в мыслях убийство
У меня на кону деньги, я не проиграю, если попробую
Ни одна шлюха не сможет сбить меня с толку
Выбрана, я поставлю на себя
Выбрана, все мои вещи — старинные
Замерзаю, я не чувствую тепла
Бриллианты танцуют на мне
Ты начал с чистого листа, чувак, ты выбился из колеи
Ты трахнул ту девушку, с которой познакомился на вечеринке
У меня там новые парни в холле
Как я могу спать, когда ты убиваешь людей?
Я всё равно хочу быть с тобой, поверь, я знаю, что это безумие
Я бы предпочла трахаться с тобой, чем с какими-то лентяями
Я сделала что-то в Берлине, у меня передозировка
Мы оба ничтожны и это срабатывает для меня
Срабатывает для меня, да
Я могу видеть будущее, я могу видеть будущееEmbed",9370202,"['Travis Scott', 'Future', 'SZA', 'Kanye West', 'Victory', 'Farsi', 'Nizzy', 'Nabeyin', 'Hudson Mohawke']","['Kanye West', 'BoogzDaBeast', 'Travis Scott', 'Wallis Lane', 'Jahaan Sweet', 'Nabeyin', 'Hudson Mohawke']",0,0,0,0,0,0

[Intro: Drake]
Yo no sé, yo no sé qué les pasa a estas chicas
Siento que ellas no necesitan amor
Necesitan a alguien que pueda controlarlas
¿Sabes lo que ando diciendo? Te lo diré de bien a mal
Del quien es el inteligente y quien es el tonto
De qué utensilio usar para qué comida, como
Tengo un horario que cumplir aún
No podré realmente

[Verso 1: Drake]
Estas perras realmente se dejan llevar
Comеten errores y luеgo me ruegan que me quede
Me tienen molestando como si fuera el Arrogante Tae
Tienen mi mente en un lugar terrible
Azotada y encadenada como esclavos Americanos
Actuan como si no estuvieran acostumbrados a las estancias de Sheraton
Conocí al negro que pensaste que podría reemplazarme
¿Cómo se hicieron siquiera comparaciones?
Perra, la próxima vez, lo juro por la tumba de mi abuela
Te estaré adelgazando por las decisiones de niño que tomaste
Cruzándote, cruzándote, cruzándote
Ayy, esto no es lo más pequeño, podría seguir adelante en estas perras
Envié cables en cables sobre cables, como Idris
Tienes suerte de que no retiré lo que me dieron
Podría tenerte en un plan de pago hasta que tengas 150
Y mi slime está aquí, ella tiene algunas barras para todos estos negros
Así que retrocederé y dejaré que SZA hable sus mierdas por un minuto

Tengo mucho orgullo para dejar que ningún negro quemado me ensucie

Pero conmigo ya sabes, haciendo toda esa mierda

Ten a un negro disparado, haré que su culo vea la luz, como una media luna
Saludo a QC, estoy bastante seguro de que hice P Ms como si fuera pasado el mediodía
Todo lo que realmente sé son Ws y Ms, la vida parece un baño
Todo lo que realmente sé son bolsas M, como si hubiera conducido y pedido comida rápida

Senseless sight to see
Yeah
Senseless sight to see

[Verse 1: Drake]
Feelin' young, but they treat me like the OG
And they want the tea on me, I swear these bitches nosey
Said he put some money on my head, I guess we gon' see
I won't put no money on his head, my niggas owe me
I gotta be single for a while, you can't control me
Uno, dos, tres, in a race, they can't hold me
And I show my face in a case so you know it's me
Imitation isn't flattery, it's just annoyin' me
And I'm too about it
And the dirt that they threw on my name
Turned to soil and I grew up out it
Time for y'all to figure out what y'all gon' do about it
Big wheels keep rollin', rollin'

[Chorus: Drake]
I'm outside, 29, G5, Seaside
I've been losin' friends and findin' peace
But honestly that sound like a fair trade to me
If I ever heard one and I'm still here
Outside, Frontline, Southside
I've been losin' friends and findin' peace
Honestly that sound like a fair trade to me

Look, don't invite me over if you throw another pity party
Lookin' back, it's hard to tell you where I started
I don't know who love me, but I know that it ain't everybody
I can never love her, she a busybody
Baby, if you want me, can't be turnin' up with everybody, nah
Can't be fuckin' on just anybody, yeah
I got feelings for you, that's the thing about it, yeah
You know that it's somethin' when I sing about it, yeah
Mama used to be on disability but gave me this ability
And now she walkin' with her head high and her back straight
I don't think you feelin' me, I'm out here
Bein' everything they said I wouldn't be and couldn't be
I don't know what happened to them guys that said they would be
I said see you at the top and they misunderstood me
I hold no resentment in my heart, that's that maturity
And we don't keep it on us anymore, it's with security

[Chorus: Drake, Travis Scott & Both]
I'm outside (Yeah), 29 (Yeah), G5, Seaside
I've been losin' friends and findin' peace

[Verse 3: Travis Scott]
Rollin' 84s, it ain't no safety
Ridin' rich and wavy
Gotta roll over to you, gotta get my release
Spread your legs downtown, as I'm goin' out to eat
Even hear the raw sounds when that raw got me in sleep (Oh, oh)
I'ma roll on 'em 'fore I ever let 'em roll on me
Split this one down the middle, wake up in the harmony (Sick)
Worried sick, I'm sick of worryin' (Sick, sick)
It's just the world we in, I'd rather bury them
I'm talkin' fake friends and skeletons (Yeah)
Early-mornin' shoulder rubs, the lawyer sounding celebrant (It's lit)
I'm never settlin', this shit get darker than my melanin (Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
At the crib all by myself, this shit been cavin' in
Scrollin' through my call log, by emojis, how I'm savin' 'em
Them heart eyes, that peach one, my old ones, but I favorite them
That butterfly emoji hold me down and all my babies them (Yeah)
Purple demon face one push away, he got the K on him
I broke bread instead of watchin' niggas break down (Let's go)
And saved a couple bitches too like I'm from Cape Town
Know their position, you know ass up with the face down (Let's go)
I'm never content, two mil' a event, I get it frequent
I'm make an expense, to me, it's just cents
I'm droppin' the top, not to feel the wind
I'm droppin' the top 'cause bro tryna spin
She droppin' her top, she back again
Publicly she at the crib again, company (Yeah, yeah)
I let it slide when I really shoulda slid (Oooh, ooh)
After all the shit I did
Look at how they repayin' me back (Oh, oh-oh, oh)
Now follow my rift
Tell me what type of payment is that? (Oh, oh-oh) I put that on my kid
And my trust, yeah, it is what it is (Oh, oh)

When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true

[Verse 1]
Give me a day or two to think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do, mm-mm
Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passin' through
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to (When I asked you to)
Be cool about what I was tellin' you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do (What you said you'd do)
And I'd end up more afraid
Don't say it isn't fair
You clearly werеn't aware that you made me misеrable
So if you really wanna know

Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
And all that you did was make me fuckin' sad
So don't waste the time I don't have
And don't try to make me feel bad

But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends, so I

'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down

[Pre-Chorus]
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
You with me

[Chorus]
And you say, ""As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'""

That could be a load of shit
But I just need to tell you all

[Chorus]
Some mistakes get made
That's alright, that's okay
You can think that you're in love
When you're really just engaged
Some mistakes get made
That's alright, that's okay
In the end, it's better for me
That's the moral of the story
Some mistakes get made
That's alright, that's okay
You can think that you're in love
When you're really just in pain
Some mistakes get made
That's alright, that's okay
In the end, it's better for me
That's the moral of the story, babe

It's been a year now, think I've figured out how
How to let you go and let communication die out

I'm about to pour up some syrup
Fucking this bitch like a perv'
Smack from the back, grab her perm
Ice, the berg, uh, shittin' on all you lil' turds
Can't take that dick, wait your turn
In my own lane, we can't merge
Suck with no hands, you can learn
Let's see how much you can earn
Watch me go big likе the Worm
And I ain't smokin' no sherm
I'm in this bitch with P Liity

All of my bitches is prеtty, they showin' they titties, it's up to the ceilin'
I let her run through a million, I rock with her really, let's fuck on a billion
I'ma get down to the gritty, then fuck up the city, the home of the villains
Ecstasy, wonderful feelin'
Smoke out the pound when I'm chillin'
Trappin', I made me a killin'
Look, I got everybody wishin'
I hope you play your position

I see the ho with precision
Get rich my only decision

Am I really hard to please?
Perhaps I have such special needs
I wondered what was wrong with me (Haha)
My friends all fall so easily (Pussies)

[Verse 1: 21 Savage]
Called the first one Savage Mode, my mood, that's what it was (21)
2016, we was ridin' around, beatin' niggas up in the club
I know she around for the money, but act like she loyal, I don't feel the love (21)
I'm so rich, get bored, might wake up, buy me a car just 'cause (On God)
Her titties is hard 'cause she spent a five, my bitch titties cost me a dub (21)
All my bitches got BBLs, all my bitches got butts (Straight up)
I ain't with thе rap beef, Draco pedophile, all of my opps get touchеd (Straight up)
We ain't never ran off on no barber, but we still be hoppin' out cuts (Straight up)

[Chorus: 21 Savage]
Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin', runnin', I leave all my cars
Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin', runnin', all my opps be
Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin', runnin', wipe his nose, it was
Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin', runnin', Savage never did no
You might also like[Verse 2: 21 Savage]
That Clasé for your wife (21), that hookah for your wife (Pussy)
I'm Slaughter Gang, pussy, you know I brought my knife (21)
He was talkin' gangster (21), we caught him at a light (Pussy)
I let my young nigga do it, it was free, he wanted a stripe (On God)
Havin' my way with the cheese, I'm in the den with the thieves (On God)
I know that she ratchet, I could tell by the way that she wearin' her weave (21)
Smokin' on zaza, this shit came out the garden with Adam and Eve (21)
Chopper go fow-fow, shoot up your pow-wow, niggas tryna make y'all bleed (21)
Got out of line, spanked that baby, we had to rock him to sleep (Pussy)
Is it a issue? Keep me a pistol, I ain't finna diss you (Pussy)
All that pillow talk, I'ma have to send The Boogeyman to come get you
Chain hang low like a yo-yo, your bitch ridin' dick like pogo

[Chorus: 21 Savage]
Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin', runnin', I leave all my cars
Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin', runnin', all my opps be
Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin', runnin', wipe his nose, it was
Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin', runnin', Savage never did no

[Outro: 21 Savage, Future & Morgan Freeman]
I brought a Hollywood bitch to Club Crucial (On God)
I was at the Met Gala with my shooter (On God)
Slaughter Gang, Gang, we don't do recruitin' (21)
Say you ready to catch a body, gotta prove it
Gotta prove that shit, nigga
Shit ain't no motherfuckin' game, nigga
Get your bitch ass whacked, nigga
Big facts, big 4L, nigga
Big Zone 6, nigga
We run the motherfuckin' city, nigga
Y'all niggas know what the fuck goin' on, nigga
Body for body, nigga, money for money, nigga

[Chorus: Swae Lee]
(Ooh) Just to save you, I'd give all of me (All of me, yeah)
I can hear you screamin' out, callin' me (Callin' me)

It's my fault, made you fall for me (Fall for me)
So, to save you, I'd give my all (My all)

[Verse 1: NAV]
You fell for me, I count on you when times are tough
Instead of holdin' you down, I should lift you up
It hurts me when you start to see my flaws (My flaws)
But just to save you, I'd risk it all (All)
Short on time for you, I'd never havе enough (Have enough)
Whеn I ran into you, I didn't plan on fallin' in love
Always there to wipe your tears, I hate to see you cry
If you tell me to jump, I'll ask you, ""How high?""
I know sometimes it be hard for me to tell the truth (Tell the truth)
But I go through any obstacle to get to you (To you)
I'm not materialistic, but I got a thing for you
Treat the world like my guitar, I'm pullin' strings for you

Let me be your hero
You held me down, I was stuck at the bottom
Get out of here, I'll get you lit, oh
I know you can't stand me
I am the one that bust down your rose gold, had your diamonds dancin'
I picked you up in that Bentley Mulsanne, when them sirens was glarin'
I gave you this number, it's nobody else that got it, you can call me
The way I let you come into my life and take my heart away, it's like a robbery
Every time you look up on the charts, now, you seein' me, I hope you proud of me
I got you bussed down, Patek Philippes, ain't no way you goin' back to Cartis
And I splurge on her, she like ""Saint Laurent me""
See me out in public, hardly
Low-key with my mask, I'm solo
If I don't speak to nobody, I'm sorry
And I'll save you if you can't save yourself
Hold on, let me catch my breath

Please do not be alarmed, remain calm
Do not attempt to leave the dance-floor
The DJ booth is conducting a troubleshoot test of the entire system

[Verse 1]
I'm one of one, I'm number one, I'm the only one
Don't even waste your time trying to compete with me (Don't do it)
No one else in this world can think like me (True)
I'm twisted (Twisted), I'll contradict it
Keep him addicted, lies on his lips, I lick it

[Pre-Chorus]
Unique
That's what you are
Stilеttos kicking vintage crystal off the bar
Category: bad bitch, I'm thе bar
Alien superstar
Whip, whip

[Chorus]
I'm too classy for this world, forever, I'm that girl
Feed you diamonds and pearls, ooh, baby
I'm too classy to be touched, I paid them all in dust
I'm stingy with my love, ooh, baby

[Verse 2]
Unicorn is the uniform you put on
Eyes on you when you perform
Eyes on I when I put on
Mastermind in haute couture
Label whores can't clock, I'm so obscure (Unique)
Masterpiece, genius
Drip intravenous
Patty cake on that wrist
Tiffany Blue billboards over that ceiling (Unique)
We don't like plain
Always dreamed of paper planes
Mile-high when I rodeo
Then I come down and take off again (Unique)
You see pleasure in my glare
Look over my shoulder and you ain't scared
The effects you have on me when you stare
Head on a pillow, hike it in the air

[Chorus]
I'm too classy for this world, forever, I'm that girl
Feed you diamonds and pearls, ooh, baby
I'm too classy to be touched, I paid them all in dust
I'm stingy with my love, ooh, baby
[Post-Chorus]
I got pearls beneath my legs, my lips, my hands, my hips (U-N-I-Q-U-E)
I got diamonds beneath my thighs where his ego will find bliss
Can't find an ocean deep that can compete with this cinnamon kiss (U-N-I-Q-U-E)
Fire beneath your feet, music when you speak, you're so unique

[Bridge]

That's what you are
Lingerie reflecting off the mirror on the bar

[Outro: Beyoncé & Barbara Ann Teer]
We dress a certain way
We walk a certain way
We talk a certain way
We, we paint a certain way
We, we make love a certain way, you know?
All of these things we do in a different
Unique, specific way that is personally ours
We just reaching out to the solar system
We flying over bullshit, we flying over
Supernatural love up in the air
I just talk my shit, Casanova
Superstar, supernova

It's the thought of being young
When your heart's just like a drum
Beating louder with no way to guard it
When it all seems like it's wrong
Just sing along to Elton John
And to that feeling, we're just getting started

[Pre-Chorus: Jimin, Jin]
When the nights get colder
And the rhythms got you falling behind
Just dream about that moment
When you look yourself right in the eye, eye, eye
Then you say

[Chorus: Jung Kook, V]
I wanna dance
The music's got me going
Ain't nothing that can stop how we move, yeah
Let's break our plans

And roll in like we're dancing fools

My eyes are caught in your gaze all over again

Most of y'all ain't wealthy (Nope), most of y'all just dress like it
I caught the vibe that y'all givin' off, and I'm tryna make myself less like it

And I got two pretty bitches, keep 'em both on fleek
They got matching Benz and matching APs
Now they can really call each other twins

And bring all of your peers, it look better with more people

Lyrics[Intro: Alexander 23]
One, two, three
Wait, is this the song with the drums?

[Verse 1]
I met a guy in the summer, and I left him in the spring
He argued with me about everything
He had an ego and a temper and a wandering eye
He said he's six-foot-two, and I'm like, ""Dude, nice try""
But he was so much fun, and he had such weird friends
And he would take us out to parties, and the night would never end
Another song, another club, another bar, another dance
And when hе said something wrong, he'd just fly me to Francе
So I miss him some nights when I'm feeling depressed
'Til I remember every time he made a pass on my friend
Do I love him? Do I hate him? I guess it's up and down
If I had to choose, I would say right now

[Chorus]
I wanna get him back
I wanna make him really jealous, wanna make him feel bad
Oh, I wanna get him back
'Cause then again, I really miss him, and it makes me real sad
Oh, I want sweet revenge, and I want him again
I want to get him back, back, back

So I write him all these letters, and I throw them in the trash
'Cause I miss the way he kisses and the way he made me laugh
Yeah, I pour my little heart out, but as I'm hitting ""send""
I picture all the faces of my disappointed friends
Because everyone knew all of the shit that he'd do
He said I was the only girl, but that just wasn't the truth
And when I told him how he hurt me, he'd tell me I was trippin'
But I am my father's daughter, so maybe I could fix him

[Chorus]
I wanna get him back
I wanna make him really jealous, wanna make him feel bad
Oh, I wanna get him back
'Cause then again, I really miss him, and it makes me real sad
Oh, I want sweet revenge, and I want him again
I want to get him back (And then? And then)
I want to get him back, back, back

[Bridge: Olivia Rodrigo, Alexander 23]

I wanna make him lunch (But then I, I want to get him back; Woo)
I wanna break his heart (But then I, I want to get him back; Yeah, you got it)
Then be the one to stitch it up (But then I, I want to get him back; yeah)
Wanna kiss his face (But then I, I want to get him back)
With an uppercut (But then I, I want to get him back)

She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?

[Chorus]
And I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

[Verse 3]
And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
And pictured I was driving home to you

Puso la espalda contra la pared

Put a bad bitch in the friendzone, ooh

Jetson, give me that tempo, ooh
Told Pooh he a fool with this shit (He a fool)
Told her don't let her friends know (Don't)
In the 'Ville and I move like a don (Don)

Me and my 'migos got that free smoke
On the West Coast, yeah, I'm talking 'bout pre-rolls (Pre-roll)
Dark haired bitch and she look like Shego (She do)

She heard of my deep stroke
She said, ""Babe, does it hurt when I deep throat?"" (It does)

I feel resentment from every direction
Even some homies be wearing expressions
I be discouraged from sharing my blessings (Damn)
We used to share a connection
Now it just feels like it's wearing and stretching
I'm getting real sick of taking advice
From people that never could stare at reflections (Ooh)
Somewhere in there is a lesson
Y'all ain't evolvin', it's very depressing
I'm at the club with the basketball team
Me and the Cardinals are sharing a section (Facts)
Gotta cherish the present
I'm drinking water and wearing protection
Got a career and I'm very invested
Some people call it a scary obsession (Ooh, period, but)
I like to call it a passion
I can't be sitting relaxin' (Nah, I can't)
PG, we getting some traction
I'm at the venue, it's packed in (Packed out)
I'm digging her accent
I got a B.B. Simon belt on me
And she tryna get it unfastened
That's my type of distraction
That's my type and she Latin (That's facts, ooh)
Got my own flow and I'm 'bout to get a patent
Brand new sheets for the bed, they satin (Soft, real soft)

[Verse 1]
Did a full one-eighty, crazy
Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up

[Refrain]
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now

[Verse 2]
Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word ""goodbye""?
Though it took some time to survive you
I'm better on the other side

Let a ho know I ain't motherfuckin' sharing
I could take you to the parents, then to Paris
Plan a motherfuckin' wedding
You the type I wanna marry (Yeah) and keep you merry
I'll put the ring on when you ready
We play our fantasies out in real life ways and
No Final Fantasy, can we end these games though?
You give me energy, make me feel lightweight (Woo)
Like the birds of a feather, baby (Woo)
We real life made for each other (Woo)
And it's hard to keep my cool
When other bitches tryna get with my dude and
When other chickens tryna get in my coop
'Cause you're a one in a million
There ain't no man like you
[Chorus]
Like you, like you
Like you, ooh
I found it hard to find someone like you
Like you, like you
Send your location, come through

[Post-Chorus]
I can't sleep no more
In my head, we belong
And I can't be without you
Why can't I find no one like you?
I can't sleep no more
In my head, we belong
And I can't be without you
Why can't I find no one like you?130Embed",4989568,"['Demarie Sheki', 'Christopher Jefferies', 'Ron “Neff-U” Feemster', 'Lydia Asrat', 'Dominique Logan', 'Yeti Beats', 'Darius Logan', 'Doja Cat']",['Blaq Tuxedo'],0,0,0,0,0,0

And we all wanna be the one to see the devastation

Then he said ""Do that pussy purr?"" I said ""Yup, meow""
Hold up, fuck-boys, ain't need no for you to roll up
Ain't no need for you to double tap neither, scroll up
Keep these bitches on they toes like Manolo
Be on the lookout when I come through, BOLO
Oh, woah, elegant bitch with a ho glow
If it ain't big, then I won't blow

I rarely get this in-depth

This girl make me feel like less of a man 'cause I'm feelin' depressed and stuff
Can't believe I was willing to drop everyone and invest in us
The last time that we fucked was fucked, the way you got up, got dressed and cut
Look, I thought that we could've been
Maybe, I was too optimistic
Tell me what you need, I'll provide everythin'

Move out of London town then move to a rural village

Ya yo necesito otro beso
Uno de esos que tú me da'
Estar lejos de ti e' el infierno
'Tar cerca de ti es mi paz
Y es que amo siempre que llegas
Y odio cuando te vas
Yo me voy contigo a matar
No me dejes solo (Sola), ¿pa' dónde vas, pa' dónde vas?

Just a little bit of regret (Regret)
Know nobody else will tell you
So there's some things I gotta say
Gonna jot it down and then get it out
And then I'll be on my way

No, you're not half the man you think that you are

'Cause you can't love nothing unless there's something in it for you

Oh, I feel so sorry, I feel so sad
I tried to help you, it just made you mad
And I had no warning about who you are
I'm just glad I made it out without breaking down

My whole squad's in here, walking around the party
A cross between a zombie apocalypse and B-Bobby ""The

Same reason I wrestle with mania
Shady's in this bitch, I'm posse'd up
Consider it to cross me a costly mistake
If they sleepin' on me, the hoes better get insomnia
ADHD, Hydroxycut
Pass the Courvoisier (Hey, hey)
In AA with an AK, melee, finna set it like a playdate
Better vacate, retreat like a vacay, mayday (Ayy)

I'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball
Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?
Risperdal, voices whisper
My fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn
This is just the song to go ballistic on
You just pulled a pistol on the guy with a missile launcher
I'm just a Loch Ness, the mythological
Quick to tell a bitch screw off like a fifth of vodka

If you never gave a damn (Ayy), raise your hand
'Cause I'm about to set trip, vacation plans
I'm on point like my index is, so all you will ever get is
The motherfuckin' finger (Finger), prostate exam ('Xam)
How can I have all these fans and perspire?
Like a liar's pants, I'm on fire
And I got no plans to retire and I'm still the man you admire
These chicks are spazzin' out, I only get more handsome and flyer
I got 'em passin' out like what you do when you hand someone flyers
And what goes around comes around just like the blades on the chainsaw
'Cause I caught the flack, but my dollars stacked right off the bat like a baseball
Like Kid Ink, bitch, I got them racks with so much ease that they call me Diddy
'Cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk (Cheesecake, yeah)
Bitch, I'm a player, I'm too motherfuckin' stingy for Cher
Won't even lend you an ear, ain't even pretending to care
But I tell a bitch I'll marry her if she'll bury her
Face in my genital area, the original Richard Ramirez
Cristhian Rivera, 'cause my lyrics never sit well
So they wanna give me the chair
Like a paraplegic, and it's scary, call it Hari Kari
'Cause e'ry Tom and Dick and Harry carry a Merriam motherfuckin' dictionary on 'em
Swearing up and down they can spit, this shit's hilarious
It's time to put these bitches in the obituary column
We wouldn't see eye to eye with a staring problem
Get the shaft like a steering column (Monster)
Trigger happy, pack heat, but it's black ink
Evil half of the Bad Meets
Evil, that means take a back seat
Take it back to Fat Beats with a maxi single
Look at my rap sheet, what attracts these people
Is my 'Gangsta Bitch' like Apache with a catchy jingle
I stack chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto
Fill 'em with the venom and eliminate 'em
Other words, I Minute Maid 'em
I don't wanna hurt 'em, but I did, I'm in a fit of rage
I'm murderin' again, nobody will evade
I'm finna kill 'em and dump all their fuckin' bodies in the lake
Obliterating everything, incinerate a renegade
I'm here to make anybody who want it with the pen afraid
But don't nobody want it, but they're gonna get it anyway
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill
I'm Attila, kill or be killed, I'm a killer bee, the vanilla gorilla
You're bringin' the killer within me outta me
You don't wanna be the enemy of the demon who entered me
And be on the receivin' end of me, what stupidity it'd be
Every bit of me's the epitome of a spitter
When I'm in the vicinity, motherfucker, you better duck
Or you finna be dead the minute you run into me
A hundred percent of you is a fifth of a percent of me
I'm 'bout to fuckin' finish you, bitch, I'm unfadable
You wanna battle, I'm available, I'm blowin' up like an inflatable

It's beautiful, it's bittersweet
You're like a broken home to me
I take a shot of memories
And black out like an empty street
I fill my days with the way you walk
And fill my nights with broken dreams
I make up lies inside my head
Like one day, you'll come back to me

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
Now I'm not holdin' on, not holdin' on
I'm just depressed that you're gone
Not holdin' on, not holdin' on

She's naked in my bed

Makin' beautiful mistakes

How every day gets worse for me

Take off the foo-foo, take off the clout chase, take off the Wi-Fi
Take off the money phone, take off the car loan, take off the flex and the white lies
Take off the weird-ass jewelry, I'ma take ten steps, then I'm taking off top five
Take off them fabricated streams and them microwave memes, it's a real world outside (Take that shit off)
Take off your idols, take off the runway, I take off to Cairo (Take that shit off)
Take off to Saint-Tropez, five-day stay, take a quarter mil', hell if I know (Take that shit off)
Take off the front flag, take off perception, take off the cop with the eye patch (Take that shit off)
Take off the unloyal, take off the unsure, take off decisions I lack (Take it off)
Take off the fake deep, take off the fake woke, take off the, ""I'm broke, I care"" (Take it off)
Take off the gossip, take off the new logic that if I'm rich, I'm rare (Take it off)
Take off the Chanel, take off the Dolce, take off the Birkin bag

Take all that designer bullshit off, and what do you have?

Fell and cut your knee
Told you not to cry and held you

I hope you see the God in me
I hope you can see
And if it's up, stay down for me

Can I trust you? Don't judge me

Mmm, ah-ah
Been waiting on your call all day
Tell me you in my corner right now
When I fall short, I'm leanin' on you to cry out
We all got enough to lie about
My truth too complicated to hide now
Can I open up? Is it safe or not?
I'm afraid a little, you relate or not?
Have faith a little, I might take my time
Ain't no savin' face this time

Take a look inside your heart, is there any room for me?

Every time I pull my hair, well, it's only out of fear
That you'll find me ugly and one day you'll disappear because
What's the point of crying? It was never even love
Did you ever want me? Was I ever good enough?

As I get a little older, I realize life is perspective
And my perspective may differ from yours
I wanna say thank you to everyone that's been down with me
All my fans, all my beautiful fans
Anyone who's ever gave me a listen, all my people

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I come from a generation of pain, where murder is minor
Rebellious and Margielas'll chip you for designer
Belt buckles and clout, overzealous if prone to violence
Make the wrong turn, be it will or the wheel alignment
Residue burned, mist of the inner-city
Miscommunication to keep homi' detective busy
No protection is risky
Desensitized, I vandalized pain, covered up and camouflaged
Get used to hearin' arsenal rain
Analyze, risk your life, take the charge
Homies done fucked your baby mama once you hit the yard
That's culture
Twenty-three hour lockdown, then somebody called
Said your lil' nephew was shot down, the culture's involved
I done seen niggas do seventeen, hit the halfway house
Get out and get his brains blown out, lookin' to buy some weed
Car wash is played out, new GoFundMe accounts'll proceed
A brand-new victim'll shatter those dreams
The culture
You might also like[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar with Marvin Gaye]
(I want, I want, I want, I want)
But I want you to want me too (I want, I want, I want, I want)
I want the hood to want me back (I want, I want, I want, I want)
I want the hood
Look what I done for you (Look what I done for you)
Look what I done for you

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I said I do this for my culture
To let y'all know what a nigga look like in a bulletproof Rover
In my mama's sofa was a doo-doo popper
Hair trigger, walk up closer, ain't no Photoshoppin'
Friends bipolar, grab you by your pockets
No option if you froze up, always play the offense
Niggas goin' to work and sellin' work, late for work
Workin' late, prayin' for work, but he on paperwork
That's the culture, point the finger, promote ya
Remote location, witness protection, they gon' hold ya
The streets got me fucked up, y'all can miss me
I wanna represent for us
New revolution was up and movin'
I'm in Argentina wiping my tears, full of confusion
Water in between us, another peer's been executed
History repeats again
Make amends, then find a nigga with the same skin to do it
But that's the culture, crack a bottle
Hard to deal with the pain when you're sober
By tomorrow, we forget the remains, we start over
That's the problem
Our foundation was trained to accept whatever follows
Dehumanized, insensitive
Scrutinize the way we live for you and I
Enemies shook my hand, I can promise I'll meet you
In the land where no equal is your equal
Never say I ain't told ya, nah
In the land where hurt people hurt more people
Fuck callin' it culture
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar with Marvin Gaye]
(I want, I want, I want, I want)
But I want you to want me too (I want, I want, I want, I want)
I want the hood to want me back (I want, I want, I want, I want)
I want the hood
Look what I done for you (Look what I done for you)
Look what I done for you

[Interlude: Kendrick Lamar]
Take the drums out

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Celebrate new life when it come back around
The purpose is in the lessons we learnin' now
Sacrifice personal gain over everything
Just to see the next generation better than ours
I wasn't perfect, the skin I was in had truly suffered
Temptation, impatience, everything that the body nurtures
I felt the good, I felt the bad, and I felt the worry
But all-in-all, my productivity had stayed urgent
Face your fears, always knew that I would make it here
Where the energy is magnified and persevered
Consciousness is synchronized and crystal-clear
Euphoria is glorified and made His
Reflectin' on my life and what I done
Paid dues, made rules, change outta love
Them same views made schools change curriculums
But didn't change me starin' down the barrel of the gun
Should I feel resentful I didn't see my full potential?
Should I feel regret about the good that I was into?
Everything is everything, this ain't coincidental
I woke up that morning with more heart to give you
As I bleed through the speakers, feel my presence
To my brother, to my kids, I'm in Heaven
To my mother, to my sis, I'm in Heaven
To my father, to my wife, I am serious, this is Heaven
To my friends, make sure you countin' them blessings
To my fans, make sure you make them investments
And to the killer that sped up my demise
I forgive you, just know your soul's in question
I seen the pain in your pupil when that trigger had squeezed
And though you did me gruesome, I was surely relieved
I completed my mission, wasn't ready to leave
But fulfilled my days, my Creator was pleased
I can't stress how I love y'all
I don't need to be in flesh just to hug y'all
The memories recollect just because y'all
Celebrate me with respect
The unity we protect is above all
And Sam, I'll be watchin' over you
Make sure my kids watch all my interviews
Make sure you live out our dreams we produced
Keep that genius in your brain on the move
And to my neighborhood, let the good prevail
Make sure them babies and the leaders outta jail
Look for salvation when troubles get real
'Cause you can't help the world until you help yourself
And I can't blame the hood the day that I was killed
Y'all had to see it, that's the only way to feel
And though my physical won't reap the benefits
The energy that carry on emits still

[Verse 1]
Pull up, skrrt-skrrt on your body
Performin' just like my 'Rari
You're too fine, need a ticket
I bet you taste expensive
Pourin' up, up, up by the liter
If you keepin' up, you's a keeper
Tequila and vodka
Girl, you might be a problem

[Pre-Chorus]
Run away, run away, run away, run away, I know that I should
But my heart wanna stay, wanna stay, wanna stay, wanna stay now
You can see it in my eyes that I wanna take you down right now if I could
So I hope you know what I mean when I say

[Chorus]
Let me take you dancin'
Two-step to the bedroom
We don't need no dancefloor
Let me see your best move
Anything could happen
Ever since I met you
No need to imagine

Is let me take you dancing

All of my diamonds are drippin' on him
I met him at the bar, it was twelve or something
I ordered two more wines 'cause tonight, I want him

[Verse 1: RAYE]
A little context if you care to listen
I find myself in a shit position
The man that I love sat me down last night
And he told me that it's over, dumb decision
And I don't wanna feel how my heart is rippin'
In fact, I don't wanna feel, so I stick to sippin'
And I'm out on the town with a simple mission
In my little black dress and this shit is sittin'

Just a heart broke bitch, high heels six inch
In the back of the nightclub, sippin' champagne
I don't trust any of these bitches I'm with
In the back of the taxi sniffin' cocaine

Last night really was the cherry on the cake
Been some dark days lately and I'm findin' it cripplin'
Excuse my state, I'm as high as your hopes
That you'll make it to my bed, get me hot and sizzlin'
If I take a step back to see the glass half-full
At least it's the Prada two-piece that I'm trippin' in
And I'm already actin' like a dick, know what I mean?

No son ni Reebok ni son Nike (No)
Sin estilista luzco fly (Yes)
La Rosalía me dice que luzco guay (La Rosalía)
No te lo niego porque yo sé lo que hay (Wuh)
Lo que se ve, no se pregunta (Na')
Soy próspero y tengo claro que e' mi culpa (Es mi culpa, culpa; ah)
Como Canelo en el ring nada me asusta
Vivo en mi base y la paz no me la tumban (Wuh)
Hakuna matata como Timón y Pumba
Voy pa' leyenda así que dale zumba
Los dejo ciego' con la vibra que me alumbra
Haters pa' la tumba, nosotros pa' la rumba (Ra)

Addicted to your touch

Big communication, tell me what you want
Translate your vibration, let your body talk to me

Every stimulation, promise I can take
