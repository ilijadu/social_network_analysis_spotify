We Found Love,Rihanna,"69 ContributorsTranslationsPortuguêsEnglishFrançaisDeutschWe Found Love Lyrics[Video Intro: Agyness Deyn]
It's like you're screaming, and no one can hear
You almost feel ashamed, that someone could be that important
That without them, you feel like nothing
No one will ever understand how much it hurts
You feel hopeless, like nothing can save you
And when it's over and it's gone
You almost wish you could have all that bad stuff back
So that you could have the good

[Verse 1]
Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive

[Pre-Chorus]
It's the way I'm feeling, I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go

We found love in a hopeless place

Give me a second I, I need to get my story straight

My seat's been taken by some sunglasses askin' 'bout a scar, and
I know I gave it to you months ago
I know you're tryin' to forget
But between the drinks and subtle things
The holes in my apologies
You know, I'm tryin' hard to take it back

Mic check, one, two
Shut 'em down in the club, what a playboy does

What happens to that body is a private show
Stays right here, pri-private show

I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me

So this is what you meant
When you said that you were spent
And now it's time to build from the bottom of the pit
Right to the top
Don't hold back
Packing my bags and giving the academy a rain check

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't ever wanna let you down
I don't ever wanna leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night

[Chorus]
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand?
That I'm never changing who I am

So this is where you fell
And I am left to sell
The path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell
Right to the top
Don't look back
Turn in the rags and giving the commodities a rain check

I'm at a payphone, tryin' to call home
All of my change I spent on you
Where have the times gone? Baby, it's all wrong
Where are the plans we made for two?

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try?
And in our time that you wasted
All of our bridges burned down

[Pre-Chorus: Adam Levine]
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time
When we called it ""Love""
But even the sun
Sets in paradise

Wondering why it wasn't you who came up from nothin'
Made it from the bottom, now when you see me, I'm stuntin'
And all of my cars start with the push of a button
Telling me I changed since I blew up or whatever you call it
Switched the number to my phone so you never could call it
Don't need my name on my shirt, you can tell that I'm ballin'
Swish, what a shame, coulda got picked
Had a really good game, but you missed your last shot
So you talk about who you see at the top
Or what you could've saw, but sad to say it's over for

The One That Got Away,Katy Perry,"110 ContributorsTranslationsPortuguêsFrançaisItalianoTürkçeDeutschEspañolThe One That Got Away Lyrics[Verse 1]
Summer after high school, when we first met
We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my eighteenth birthday, we got matching tattoos
Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talked about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day, I'd be losing you

[Chorus]
In another life
I would be your girl
We'd keep all our promises
Be us against the world
In another life
I would make you stay
So I don't have to say you were
The one that got away
The one that got away

[Verse 2]
I was June, and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on, woah
Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown, singing the blues
It's time to face the music, I'm no longer your muse

All this money can't buy me a time machine, no
Can't replace you with a million rings, no
I should've told you what you meant to me, woah

I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying, ""This is it, I've had enough,"" 'cause like
We hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space (What?)
Then you come around again and say
""Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me""
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, ""I hate you,"" we break up, you call me, ""I love you""

You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together

Candy,Robbie Williams,"34 ContributorsCandy Lyrics[Verse 1]
I was there to witness
Candice's inner business
She wants the boys to notice
Her rainbows and her ponies
She was educated
But could not count to ten
Now she got lots of different horses
By lots of different men

[Pre-Chorus]
And I say, ""Liberate your sons and daughters""
The bush is high, but in the hole, there's water
You can get some when they give it
Nothing sacred, but it's a living

[Chorus]
Hey, oh, here she goes
Either a little too high or a little too low
Got no self-esteem and vertigo
'Cause she thinks she's made of candy
Hey, oh, here she goes
Either a little too loud or a little too close
Got a hurricane at the back of her throat
She thinks she's made of candy

Ring a ring of roses
Whoever gets the closest
She comes and she goes
As the war of the roses
Mother was a victim
Father beat the system
By moving bricks to Brixton

""Go play your video game""

Dreams; that's where I have to go
To see your beautiful face anymore
I stare at a picture of you and listen to the radio
Hope; hope there's a conversation
We both admit we had it good
But until then, it's alienation, I know
That much is understood
And I realize

[Chorus]
If you ask me how I'm doing
I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind
(You're not on my mind, you're not on my mind)
But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two
And finally, I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say, I'm not over you
Not over you (Not over you)

[Verse 2]
Damn, damn, girl, you do it well
And I thought you were innocent
Took this heart and put it through hell
But still, you're magnificent
I, I'm a boomerang, doesn't matter how you throw me
I turn around and I'm back in the game
Even better than the old me (Old me)
But I'm not even close without you

Hope the wound heals but it never does
That's 'cause you at war with love
You at war with love, yeah

[Chorus: Guy Sebastian]
These battle scars don't look like they're fading
Don't look like they're ever going away
They ain't never gonna change
These battle

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
(Uh)
Never let a wound ruin me
But I feel like ruins wound me
Arrow holes that never close from Cupid on a shootin' spree
Feeling stupid 'cause I know it ain't no you and me
But when you're tryin' to beat the odds up
Been tryin' to keep your nods up and you know that you should know (You know)
And let her go but the fear of the unknown
Holding on another lover's phone sends you back into the zone
(Go) With no Tom Hanks to bring you home
A lover, not a fighter on the frontline with a poem
Tryin' to write yourself a rifle, maybe sharpen up a song
To fight the tanks and drones of you being alone

I wish I never looked, I wish I never touched
I wish that I could stop loving you so much (Much)
'Cause I'm the only one that's tryna keep us together (Yeah)
When all of the signs say that I should forget her (Uh-huh)
I wish you weren't the best (Best), the best I ever had (Had)
I wish that the good outweighed the bad (Yeah)
'Cause it'll never be over (It'll never be over)
Until you tell me it's over (Until you tell me it's over, yeah)

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
(Then just leave then)
You shouldn't have but you said it
(And I hope you never come back)
It shouldn't have happened but you let it
Now you're down on the ground, screaming, ""Medic""
The only thing that comes is the post-traumatic stresses
Shields, body armors, and vests
Don't properly work, that's why you're in a locker full of hurt
The enemy within and all the fires from your friends
The best medicine is to probably just let her win
[Pre-Chorus: Guy Sebastian & Lupe Fiasco]
I wish I couldn't feel, I wish I couldn't love
I wish that I could stop 'cause it hurts so much (So much)
'Cause I'm the only one that's trying to keep us together (Yeah)
When all of the signs say that I should forget her (Yeah)
I wish you weren't the best (Best), the best I ever had (Had)

But there's something inside that I need to release

It Will Rain,Bruno Mars,"72 ContributorsIt Will Rain Lyrics[Verse 1]
If you ever leave me, baby
Leave some morphine at my door
'Cause it would take a whole lot of medication
To realize what we used to have
We don't have it anymore
There's no religion that could save me
No matter how long my knees are on the floor, oh
So keep in mind all the sacrifices I'm makin'
To keep you by my side
To keep you from walkin' out the door

[Chorus]
'Cause there'll be no sunlight, if I lose you, baby
There'll be no clear skies, if I lose you, baby
Just like the clouds, my eyes will do the same
If you walk away, every day, it'll rain, rain, rain

[Verse 2]
I'll never be your mother's favorite
Your daddy can't even look me in the eye
Ooh, if I was in their shoes, I'd be doing the same thing
Saying, ""There goes my little girl
Walking with that troublesome guy""
But they're just afraid of something they can't understand
Ooh, but, little darling, watch me change their minds
Yeah, for you, I'll try, I'll try, I'll try, I'll try

Swept away, I'm stolen

So what we get drunk?
So what we smoke weed?
We're just having fun
We don't care who sees (Shit)
So what we go out? (Ayy, lemme get a lighter, please?)
That's how it's supposed to be ('Cause you know I'm high as fuck and I forgot one)
Living young and wild and free (Keep that in there)

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Ah, ah-ah
So what I keep 'em rolled up?
Saggin' my pants, not carin' what I show
Keep it real with my niggas, keep it player for these hoes
It look clean, don't it?
Washed it the other day, watch how you lean on it
Give me some 501 jeans on it
Roll joints bigger than King Kong's fingers
And smoke them hoes down 'til they stingers
You a class clown and if I skip for the day
I'm with your bitch smokin' grade A

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
You know what? It's like I'm seventeen again
Peach fuzz on my face, lookin' on the case
Tryna find a hella taste, oh, my God
I'm on the chase, Chevy, It's gettin' kinda heavy, relevant, sellin' it
Dippin' away, time keeps slippin' away
Zip in the safe, flippin' for pay
Tippin' like I'm drippin' in paint

Soon as you thinkin' you're down
Find how to turn things around
Now things are lookin' up
From the ground up, pound up, this Taylor Gang
So turn my sound up and mount up and do my thang
Uh, now I'm chillin', fresh outta class, feelin'
Like I'm on my own and I could probably own a building
Got my own car, no job, no children
Had a science project, me and Mac killed it

This is us, we gon' fuss
And we gon' fight and we gon' roll

Ass Back Home (feat. Neon Hitch),Gym Class Heroes,"20 ContributorsAss Back Home Lyrics[Intro: Travie McCoy]
Oh, it's so sexy, yo

[Chorus: Neon Hitch & Travie McCoy]
I don't know where you're going
Or when you're coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door (Ya)
For one more chance to hold you close
(It's your boy Travie, Gym Class Heroes)
I don't know where you're going (Let's go, yeah)
Just get your ass back home

[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]
We both knew this type of life didn't come with instructions (No)
So I'm trying to do my best to make something out of nothing
And sometimes it gets down right shitty in fact
When you call and I don't even know what city I'm at
Or what day of the week in the middle of the month
In a year I don't recall
It's like my life's on repeat and the last time we spoke I told you I wouldn't be long
That was last November, now December's almost gone
I'd apologize, but I don't realize what I'm doing wrong
I never know

[Chorus: Neon Hitch & Travie McCoy]
I don't know where you're going
Or when you're coming home
I left the keys under the mat to our front door (That's love, yeah)
For one more chance to hold you close
I don't know where you're going (Uh-huh, okay, what's that?)
Just get your ass back home

And you've been nothing but amazing and I'll never take that for granted
Half of these birds would've flew the coop but you, you truly understand it
And the fact you stood beside me every time you heard some bogusness (Tough love)
You deserve a standing O cause they'd have just been over it
Let 'em talk, let 'em talk, let 'em talk, let 'em talk
Like we don't hear what they saying
Let 'em walk, let 'em walk, let 'em walk, let 'em walk
We'll just drive by and keep waving
'Cause you and I above all that, just let 'em wallow in it
And now they all choked up, yuck, 'cause they be swallowin' it

[Chorus: Neon Hitch & Travie McCoy]
I don't know where you're going (Yeah)
Or when you're coming home (Alright)
I left the keys under the mat (I'm coming home, mama)
(Mama, I'm coming home)
To our front door (That's love)
For one more chance to hold you close
I don't know where you're going (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

No one holds me down like you do, sweetheart
You keep doing that, I'll keep doing this
And we'll be alright, trust that
We put the ""us"" in ""trust"", baby

I don't care what you're after
As long as I'm the one, no

All these kinds of places make it seem like it's been ages
Tomorrow, some new building will scrape the sky
I love this country dearly, I can feel the ladder clearly
But I never thought I'd be alone to try
Once, I was outside Penn Station selling red and white carnations
We were still alone, my wife and I
Before we married, saved my money, brought my dear wife over
Now I work to bring my family stateside

[Pre-Chorus]
But off the boat, they stayed a while, then scattered across the coast
Once a year I'll see them for a week or so at most

[Chorus]
I took a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk (Oh)
I took a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk (Oh)

[Verse 2]
Practice isn't perfect, but the market cuts a loss
I remind myself that times could be much worse
My wife won't ask me questions, there's not so much to ask
And she'll never flaunt around an empty purse
Once, my mother-in-law came just to stay a couple nights
Then decided she would stay the rest of her life
I watch my little children play some board game in the kitchen
And I sit and pray they never feel my strife

[Verse 1]
I remember years ago
Someone told me I should take
Caution when it comes to love, I did
And you were strong and I was not
My illusion, my mistake
I was careless, I forgot, I did

[Pre-Chorus]
And now
When all is done, there is nothing to say
You have gone and so effortlessly
You have won, you can go ahead tell them

[Chorus]
Tell them all I know now
Shout it from the rooftops
Write it on the skyline
All we had is gone now
Tell them I was happy
And my heart is broken
All my scars are open
Tell them what I hoped would be
Impossible, impossible

Dirty Paws,Of Monsters and Men,"58 ContributorsTranslationsEnglishDirty Paws Lyrics[Verse 1]
Jumping up and down the floor
My head, is an animal
And once there was an animal
It had a son that mowed the lawn
The son was an okay guy
They had a pet dragonfly
The dragonfly, it ran away
But it came back with a story to say

[Instrumental Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Her dirty paws and furry coat
She ran down the forest slopes
The forest of talking trees
They used to sing about the birds and the bees
The bees had declared a war
The sky wasn't big enough for them all
The birds, they got help from below
From Dirty Paws and the creatures of snow

So for a while, things were cold
They were scared down in their holes
The forest that once was green
Was colored black by those killing machines
But she and her furry friends
Took down the queen bee and her men
And that's how the story goes
The story of the beast with those four dirty paws

Why? (Got that?)

[Verse 1: Lana Del Rey, Mountain]
Feet don't fail me now, take me to the finish line
Oh, my heart, it breaks every step that I take
But I'm hoping that the gates, they'll tell me that you're mine
Walking through the city streets, is it by mistake or design?
I feel so alone on a Friday night
Can you make it feel like home if I tell you you're mine?
It's like I told you, honey (Louder)

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes, love is not enough
And the road gets tough, I don't know why
Keep makin' me laugh, let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey, Mountain]
Come and take a walk on the wild side

Tell Uncle Luke I'm out in Miami too
Clubbin' hard, fuckin' women, there ain't much to do

Still gettin' brain from a thang, ain't shit changed
How you feel, how you feel, how you feel?
Twenty-five, sitting on twenty-five mil', uh
I'm in the building and I'm feeling myself
Rest in peace Mac Dre, I'ma do it for the Bay, okay
Gettin' paid, we'll holler whenever that stop

Tell Tune light one, pass it like a relay

We lifted this house, we lifted this house
Firecrackers in the east, my car parked south
Your hands on my cheeks, your shoulder in my mouth
I was up against the wall on the west mezzanine
We rattle this town, we rattle this scene

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, Anna Sun
Oh, Anna Sun

[Chorus]
What do you know? This house is falling apart
What can I say? This house is falling apart
We got no money, but we got heart
We're gonna rattle this ghost town
This house is falling apart

Screen falling off the door, door hanging off the hinges
My feet are still sore, my back's on the fringes

Live my life without
Station wagon rides
Fumbling around the back
Not one seat belt on
Wait for summertime
Coming up for air
Now it's all a wash
Now it's all a wash
(Screen falling off the door, door hanging off the hinges)
Live my life without
(My feet are still sore, my back's on the fringes)
Coming up for air

Now it's all a wash
(We lifted this house, we lifted this house)
I want everyone
(Firecrackers in the east, my car parked south)
Racing down the hill

I am faster than you

Wake up (Drank)
Faded (Drank)
Faded (Drank)

[Verse 1]
Now, I done grew up round some people
Livin' their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask
Backstroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feel
Some people wanna kill their sorrow
Some people wanna fit in with the popular
That was my problem
I was in a dark room, loud tunes
Lookin' to make a vow soon
That “I'ma get fucked up”
Fillin' up my cup, I see the crowd mood
Changin' by the minute
And the record on repeat
Took a sip, then another sip
Then somebody said to me
You might also like[Chorus]
“Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch”
First, you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Then, I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it
Po-Pool full of liquor, I'ma dive in it

[Verse 2]
Okay, now open your mind up and listen me, Kendrick
I am your conscience, if you do not hear me then you will be history, Kendrick
I know that you're nauseous right now and I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, Kendrick
If I take another one down, I'ma drown in some poison, abusin' my limit
I think that I'm feelin' the vibe, I see the love in her eyes
I see the feelin', the freedom is granted as soon as the damage of vodka arrived
This how you capitalize, this is parental advised, and apparently, I'm over-influenced
By what you are doin', I thought I was doin' the most 'til someone said to me
[Chorus]
“Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch”
First, you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it

[Verse 3]
All I—all I—all I—
All I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got hunger pain that grow insane, tell me, do that sound familiar?
If it do, then you're like me, makin' excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of a bottle and the greenest indo leaf
As the window open I release everything that corrode inside of me
I see you jokin', why you laugh? Don't you feel bad? I prob'ly sleep
And never ever wake up, never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust, but just when I thought I had enough

Them niggas stole my swag but I don't want it back

You see it in my closet before it's on the rack
Was out there in Hawaii, now I'm goin back
My nigga uh! I got so much money I should start a bank
So much paper right in front of me it's hard to think
Buy so many bottles it's gon' be hard to drink
But I'm still pourin' up and my family here and they rolling up so uh!

Woop, turn the lights on
Oh woah, oh woah

[Verse 1]
We share somethin' so common, but still so rare
And I'm in awe, never been here before
So high, we're still climbin', even here inside these walls
Breakin' each others hearts and we don't care 'cause we're so

[Chorus]
In too deep, can't think about givin' it up
But I never knew love, would feel like a heart attack
It's killin' me, swear I never cried so much
'Cause I never knew love would hurt this fuckin' bad
The worst pain that I ever had (Turn the lights on)
Oh woah, never knew love, oh woah
Would hurt this fuckin' bad
The worst pain that I ever had

[Verse 2]
All the times when I know I should be smilin'
Seem to be the time that I frown the most
Can't believe that we're still survivin'
'Cause I'm slowly breakin' down even when I hold you close
And if I lose you, I'm afraid I would lose who
Who I gave my love to
That's the reason I stay around
Even though I fell way

R U Mine?,Arctic Monkeys,"103 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolFrançaisDeutschItalianoR U Mine? Lyrics[Verse 1]
I'm a puppet on a string
Tracy Island, time-traveling
Diamond cutter-shaped heartaches
That come to find you four in some velvet morning
Years too late, she's a silver lining
Lone ranger riding through an open space
In my mind when she's not right there beside me

[Chorus]
I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself, all I
Wanna hear her say is ""Are you mine?""
Well, are you mine?
Are you mine?
Are you mine? Oh, ah

[Verse 2]
I guess what I'm trying to say is I need the deep end
Keep imagining meeting, wished away entire lifetimes
Unfair we're not somewhere misbehaving for days
Great escape, lost track of time and space
She's a silver lining climbing on my desire

[Chorus]
And I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself, all I
Wanna hear her say is ""Are you mine?""
Well, are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?)
Are you mine? (Or just mine tonight?)
Are you mine? (Are you mine, mine?)

Some nights, I stay up cashing in my bad luck
Some nights, I call it a draw

But I still wake up, I still see your ghost

Well, some nights, I wish that this all would end
'Cause I could use some friends for a change

Drive By,Train,"52 ContributorsDrive By Lyrics[Verse 1]
On the other side of a street I knew
Stood a girl that looked like you
I guess that's déjà vu
But I thought this can't be true
'Cause you moved to west L.A. or New York or Santa Fe
Or wherever to get away from me

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, but that one night
Was more than just right
I didn't leave you 'cause I was all through
Oh, I was overwhelmed, and frankly, scared as hell
Because I really fell for you

[Chorus]
Oh, I swear to you
I'll be there for you
This is not a drive by
Just a shy guy looking for a two-ply
Hefty bag to hold my love
When you move me, everything is groovy
They don't like it, sue me
Mmm, the way you do me
Oh, I swear to you

And I loved you every mile you drove away

And get down to the ""more than friends"" at last

Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
Told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember

You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

But had me believing it was always something that I'd done
But I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

You know the bed feels warmer
Sleepin' here alone (Sleepin' here alone)
You know I dream in color
And do the things I want (Do the things I want)

[Pre-Chorus]
You think you got the best of me
Think you've had the last laugh
Bet you think that everything good is gone
Think you left me broken down
Think that I'll come running back
Baby, you don't know me, 'cause you're dead wrong

[Chorus]
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean I'm over 'cause you're gone
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stronger
Just me, myself, and I
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone

Blow Me (One Last Kiss),P!nk,"30 ContributorsBlow Me (One Last Kiss) Lyrics[Verse 1]
White knuckles
And sweaty palms from hanging on too tight
Clenched shut jaw
I've got another headache again tonight
Eyes on fire, eyes on fire
And they burn from all the tears
I've been crying, I've been crying
I've been dying over you
Tie a knot in the rope
Tryna hold, tryna to hold
But there's nothing to grab
So I let go

[Chorus]
I think I finally had enough
I think I maybe think too much
I think this might be it for us
Blow me one last kiss
You think I'm just too serious
I think you're full of shit
My head is spinning so
Blow me one last kiss
Just when it can't get worse
I've had a shit day
Have you had a shit day?
We've had a shit day
I think that life's too short for this
I want back my ignorance and bliss
I think I've had enough of this

No more sick Whiskey dick
No more battles for me

I'll dress nice, I'll look good
I'll go dancing alone
I will laugh, I'll get drunk
I'll take somebody home

My heart is paralyzed
My head was oversized
I'll take the high road like I should
You said it's meant to be
That it's not you, it's me
You're leaving now for my own good

[Pre-Chorus]
That's cool, but if my friends ask where you are, I'm gonna say

[Chorus 1]
She went down in an airplane
Fried getting suntanned
Fell in a cement mixer full of quicksand
Help me, help me, I'm no good at goodbyes
She met a shark under water
Fell and no one caught her
I returned everything I ever bought her
Help me, help me, I'm all out of lies
And ways to say you died

[Verse 2]
My pride still feels the sting
You were my everything
Some day I'll find a love like yours (a love like yours)
She'll think I'm Superman
Not super minivan
How could you leave on Yom Kippur?

Primadonna girl, yeah
All I ever wanted was the world
I can't help that I need it all

But it's always someone else's fault
Got you wrapped around my finger, babe

Would you do anything for me?
Buy a big diamond ring for me?
Would you get down on your knees for me?

I really don't know why it's such a big deal though

What Makes You Beautiful,One Direction,"138 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolPortuguêsFrançaisDeutschWhat Makes You Beautiful Lyrics[Verse 1: Liam]
You're insecure, don't know what for
You're turnin' heads when you walk through the door
Don't need makeup to cover up (Huh)
Bein' the way that you are is enough

[Pre-Chorus: Harry]
Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you

[Chorus: All, Harry]
Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground, it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh-oh, you don't know you're beautiful
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know, oh-oh, you don't know you're beautiful, oh-oh
That's what makes you beautiful

[Verse 2: Zayn]
So c-come on, you got it wrong
To prove I'm right, I put it in a song
I don't know why you're being shy
And turn away when I look into your eyes
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Harry]
Everyone else in the room can see it

You don't know, oh-oh, you don't know you're beautiful (Oh)
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know, oh-oh, you don't know you're beautiful, oh-oh
That's what makes you beautiful

[Chorus: All, Harry, Zayn]

When life leaves you high and dry
I'll be at your door tonight
If you need help, if you need help
I'll shut down the city lights
I'll lie, cheat, I'll beg and bribe
To make you well, to make you well

[Verse 2]
When enemies are at your door
I'll carry you away from war
If you need help, if you need help
Your hope dangling by a string
I'll share in your suffering
To make you well, to make you well

Give me reasons to believe
That you would do the same for me

Chasing The Sun,The Wanted,"34 ContributorsChasing The Sun Lyrics[Verse 1: Tom]
I'm better, so much better now
I see the light, touch the light, we're together now
I'm better, so much better now
Look to the skies, gives me life, we're together now

[Pre-Chorus: Max, Nathan & Tom]
We've only just begun, hypnotised by drums
Until forever comes, you'll find us chasing the sun
They said this day wouldn't come, we refused to run
We've only just begun, you'll find us chasing the sun

[Chorus: All]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, you'll find us chasing the sun
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, you'll find us chasing the sun

[Post-Chorus: All & Tom]
And when the daylight's fadin'
We're gonna play in the dark till it's golden again
And now it feels so amazing
Can't see it coming, I will never grow old again
You'll find us chasing the sun

[Verse 2: Siva & Jay]
I'm never, I'm never down
Lying here, staring up, and you're looking down
I'm never, I'm never down
Live forever, forever with you around

Next To Me,Emeli Sandé,"35 ContributorsNext to Me Lyrics[Verse 1]
You won't find him drinking under tables
Rolling dice or staying out till three
You won't ever find him be unfaithful
You will find him, you'll find him next to me
You won't find him tryna chase the devil
For money, fame, for power out of greed
You won't ever find him where the rest go
You will find him, you'll find him next to me

[Chorus]
Next to me, ooh-ooh
Next to me, ooh-ooh
Next to me, ooh-ooh
You will find him, you'll find him next to me

[Verse 2]
When the money's spent and all my friends have vanished
And I can't seem to find no help or love for free
I know there's no need for me to panic
'Cause I'll find him, I'll find him next to me
When the skies are grey and all the doors are closing
And the rising pressure makes it hard to breathe
When all I need's a hand to stop the tears from falling
I will find him, I'll find him next to me

When we've spoilt the land and dried up all the sea
When everyone has lost their heads around us
